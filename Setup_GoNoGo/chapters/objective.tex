\label{sec:objective}
S: \\
Nonlinear wave events, like green water and slamming can lead to problems. \\
These event types are also very complex. \\
Main methods of investigating: experiments, some simulations \\
C: \\
Simulations still very expensive \\
Experiments done in towing tank or wave flume \\
Either limited testing times or no forward velocities \\
Can be overcome by knitting, but very expensive \\
Back in the day no problem, because limit on data we can handle \\
Not anymore, now the testing facilities and expenses are limiting \\
Large data sets needed for (name for what Sanne is doing)\\
This limited size of data sets possibly also prevents experimental data to be used for machine learning \\
Need for cheap method of generating large data sets for nonlinear wave impacts \\
Continues experiments would be perfect but not yet a facility for them\\
Q:\\
Experimental method needed that can cheaply generate data for loads of different nonlinear wave events \\
A:\\
Wave-current tank good option. Adapting flumetank by placing a wavemaker and beach on it\\
Does have limits (wave reflections, scale), but can give great insight into the stochastic of events like green water and slamming \\
\\


Such a wave-current tank created \\
Green water experiments conducted to see if it works \\
Validated with green water experiments in towing tank (same model) \\


First insights from big data (to show value of such a test facility)\\
