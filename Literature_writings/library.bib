abstract = {Greenwater overtopping of a 2D fixed rectangular box due to focused wave groups is investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Simulations span a wide parameter space, such that a range of overtopping types previously observed in experiments - including dam-break, plunging plus dam-break and hammer fist events - are observed. For each greenwater event the horizontal momentum flux and overtopping volume are computed, as these represent integrated quantities linked to damage potential on offshore facilities. These values are compared to simplified predictions based on the classical dam-break model with the dam height based on a run-up calculation on the box. It is found that these predictions deviate from measurements made in the CFD simulations because the classical model omits physics evident during overtopping events. Modifications to the classical dam-break model are presented to account for (i) the finite duration of an overtopping event; (ii) the finite quantity of water in the crest of a wave which exceeds the freeboard; (iii) the local geometry at the edge of the box; and (iv) the horizontal momentum in the crest of a wave which exceeds the freeboard. Insight gained from the first of these corrections leads to a new parameter- the relative overtopping duration T ' , defined as the ratio of the duration for which fluid exceeds the freeboard to the natural time scale for runout of a dam with height equal to maximum run-up above freeboard. It is found that this new parameter dramatically reduces scatter in the integrated quantities. The results suggest that this new parameter, which combines freeboard exceedance and overtopping duration, may be an efficient indicator for screening metocean conditions to identify design sea states.},

abstract = {The structure of turbulence in a spilling breaker has been studied experimentally based on the transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy (the k-equation). We study turbulence transport in the evolving flow from the breaking point to the inner surf zone in the region below trough level and above the bottom boundary layer. The study shows that turbulence transport processes are similar in the outer and inner surf zones. It is found that diffusive transport plays the most important role in the distribution of turbulence, while advection is important mainly near the surface. It is also found that although turbulence production below trough level amounts to only a small portion of the wave energy loss, the production term is not small compared to the dissipation term and the major terms in the k-equation and thus it cannot be neglected. The mixing length is estimated based on the measured rates of vertical advance of the turbulent front, and comparisons of turbulence production and energy dissipation. The results are similar to those found in previous studies. It is shown that the length scale and velocity scale of the large eddies are subject to turbulence transport processes, therefore their distributions cannot be prescribed in an easy way. The relative values of the components of the Reynolds stress tensor are examined. The results of analysis supports the notion that surf-zone turbulence created by spilling and plunging breakers differ primarily in the method of energy transfer from organized wave-induced motion to turbulent motion, and the constraints imposed by the mean flow and the solid bottom on the large-scale turbulence.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments have been performed to elucidate the phenomenon of high frequency energy generation observed in the power spectra of waves traveling over submerged bars. Wave breaking itself, even in the case of plunging breakers, is found to be a secondary effect in this process, contributing by dissipating the overall wave energy without changing its relative spectral distribution significantly. The dominant physical mechanism is the amplification of the bound harmonics during the shoaling process, and their release in the deeper region, resulting in the decomposition of these finite amplitude waves. The observations suggest the feasibility of numerical modeling of the harmonics generation and release in breaking waves on the basis of a model for nonlinear conservative (non-dissipative) wave-wave interaction, to simulate the evolution of the spectral shape, in conjunction with a (semi-empirical) model for the dissipation of the total energy due to breaking. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The characteristics of turbulence created by a plunging breaker on a 1 on 35 plane slope have been studied experimentally in a two-dimensional wave tank. The experiments involved detailed measurements of fluid velocities below trough level and water surface elevations in the surf zone using a fibre-optic laser-Doppler anemometer and a capacitance wave gage. The dynamical role of turbulence is examined making use of the transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy (the k-equation). The results show that turbulence under a plunging breaker is dominated by large-scale motions and has certain unique features that are associated with its wave condition. It was found that the nature of turbulence transport in the inner surf zone depends on a particular wave condition and it is not similar for different types of breakers. Turbulent kinetic energy is transported landward under a plunging breaker and dissipated within one wave cycle. This is different from spilling breakers where turbulent kinetic energy is transported seaward and the dissipation rate is much slower. The analysis of the k-equation shows that advective and diffusive transport of turbulence play a major role in the distribution of turbulence under a plunging breaker, while production and dissipation are not in local equilibrium but are of the same order of magnitude. Based on certain approximate analytical approaches and experimental measurements it is shown that turbulence production and viscous dissipation below trough level amount to only a small portion of the wave energy loss caused by wave breaking. It is suggested that the onshore sediment transport produced by swell waves may be tied in a direct way to the unique characteristics of turbulent flows in these waves.},

abstract = {Scatter from the sea near. grazing from MF through VHF is analyzed in this paper. Results based on the compensation theorem show that the dependence upon the grazing angles, as well as upon frequency, range, and the effective surface impedance, can be removed for vertical polarization as the familiar “Norton attenuation factors.” Time variation of the surface is included, and results are derived for both the average received power and its spectral density. The first-order dispersion relationship for gravity waves is used to show that the received spectrum from a patch of sea consists of two discrete Doppler shifts above and below the carrier, predictable from simple Bragg diffraction considerations. Using the Phillips wind-wave model as an upper limit for wave heights, estimates for $\sigma$0 (radar cross section per unit area) of - 17 dB are obtained near grazing. Both the magnitude of $\sigma$nv0predicted from theory and the nature of the received spectrum are compared with measurements, and the agreement supports the theory on both counts. Finally, the use of MF/HF radars for measuring sea state is suggested and discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1972 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.},

abstract = {The inclusion of current in a water channel is a critical requirement for recreating accurately scaled ocean environments in a laboratory. In this paper, the effect of a uniform current on the theoretical model of a plunger-type wavemaker has been investigated through a variance-based global sensitivity analysis. The output of the wavemaker model is represented by the ratio of wave amplitude to stroke amplitude. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis evaluates the influence of all uncertain input parameters on the output variance of the model. In addition to the water current, the uncertain input parameters for the wavemaker model were established as the wave frequency, wedge angle, mean wedge depth, water height, and node points on the wavemaker boundary. To account for a range of limitations for both the plunger and the water channel in which it oscillates, the sensitivity analysis was performed for a broad distribution of each parameter. The analysis determined that the wave frequency had the highest influence on the output variance of the wavemaker model. For a uniform water current, the first order and total effect sensitivity indices were estimated as 0.74 ± 0.30% and 6.84 ± 0.16%, respectively. Although the sensitivity of the model to the current was relatively low compared to the wave frequency, there exists an impact due to the interaction of the current with the other parameters. Therefore, it was established that the inclusion of the current in the plunger-type wavemaker model is essential for application of the model to an experimental setup.},

Experimentally, the water on deck for a fixed barge-shaped structure has been analysed. Video images of the watershipping events were recorded, wave elevation in the wave flume and pressure on a vertical superstructure along the 'ship' deck have been measured. Numerically, a boundary element method for unsteady nonlinear free-surface flows was developed and used for the analysis of water-on-deck phenomena. A comprehensive comparison between experimental and numerical data gave satisfactory agreement globally. The synergic experimental-numerical analysis highlights the main flow features during the water shipping and details of the water impact with the deck structures are discussed. In the model tests, the water on deck started as a plunging wave hitting the deck and entrapping air. This could be relevant for deck safety, but appears to be less important for the global evolution of the water along the deck and the later liquid interaction with the superstructure. The green-water loads on the vertical wall showed a two-peak behaviour typical of wave impacts. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {<p>Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.</p>},

abstract = {We present the concepts of physics-based learning models (PBLM) and their relevance and application to the field of ship hydrodynamics. The utility of physics-based learning is motivated by contrasting generic learning models for regression predictions, which do not presume any knowledge of the system other than the training data provided with methods such as semi-empirical models, which incorporate physical insights along with data-fitting. PBLM provides a framework wherein intermediate models, which capture (some) physical aspects of the problem, are incorporated into modern generic learning tools to substantially improve the predictions of the latter, minimizing the reliance on costly experimental measurements or high-resolution highfidelity numerical solutions. To illustrate the versatility and efficacy of PBLM, we present three wave-ship interaction problems: 1) at speed waterline profiles; 2) ship motions in head seas; and 3) three-dimensional breaking bow waves. PBLM is shown to be robust and produce error rates at or below the uncertainty in the generated data at a small fraction of the expense of high-resolution numerical predictions.},

abstract = {In real ocean environments, offshore structures are exposed to a combination of wave and current loading conditions. This scenario presents the need to study fluid-structure interactions in the presence of both conditions, achievable through experimentation in a recirculating flume coupled with a wavemaker. The Ocean Resources and Renewable Energy (ORRE) group set out to design a recirculating wave-current flume at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to enable the study of technologies such as scale floating platforms and marine energy converters. In this paper, we present the methods used to arrive at an optimal flume design under strict spatial constraints posed by the available lab space. Limitations on the length, width, and height of flume are overcome via innovative flow designs and compact structures. The final design is approximately 11.5 m (37.7 ft) in length and 1.2 m (3.9 ft) wide with a nominal water depth of 1 m (3.3 ft). The 2 m long test section begins 6 m beyond the inlet of the flume to maximize flow uniformity. A 24" thruster driven by 75 hp electric motor maintains a current velocity of 0.5 m/s throughout the section while a wedge-shape plunger is implemented at the inlet to generate 0.6 - 2.8 s period waves with a maximum height of 0.2 m. During the design process, 2D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are employed to maximize flow uniformity over a range of inlet angles and guide vane configurations. In the optimal scenario, a flow nonuniformity of 8.7 % was obtained across a 0.7 m water column measured from the free surface. Results from the 3D simulation around the tight corner section showed significant increase in flow nonuniformity. The implementation of the screens along the flow path might be necessary in the future.},

abstract = {Synchronous roll and parametric roll resonance are critical phenomena that lead a ship, under certain conditions, to quickly develop large roll amplitudes. This will result in excessive accelerations that can be dangerous for a ship and her cargo. Ships with large bow and stern flare (i.e. container carriers and RoPax) are especially prone to this type of hazards. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for ship operators to be aware of a set of conditions under which these two unwanted phenomena happen. This will help implementing necessary counter measures, either operational (speed or course alterations) or tactical (route finding). In this context, the development of a fast and reliable method for screening the conditions leading to excessive accelerations would improve ship safety. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method detecting critical scenarios for a container ship in heavy weather conditions. The method utilizes an original, six-degree numerical model of ship motions, called LaiDyn, to investigate large amplitude motions and the associated longitudinal and transverse accelerations that a ship is experiencing. Finally, the accelerations that are calculated for a set of operational conditions are checked against their predefined threshold values associated with the cargo lashing system. The proposed method can be used for operational purposes, at the stage of route planning, where the expected accelerations could be considered as another objective function in the route-finding algorithm.},

The limitation of such a computational approach to a fixed free-stream Mach number is addressed by a Mach-adaptation strategy that interpolates the angle between two POD subspaces rather than the POD basis vectors directly. The predicted aeroelastic frequencies and damping ratio coefficients are compared with counterparts obtained from full-order nonlinear simulations and from flight test data. The results of these comparisons, including in the transonic regime, reveal a good potential of POD-based reduced-order modeling for the near real-time prediction of aircraft flutter using CFD technology. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The present study experimentally investigated near-bed coherent structures of turbulence over rough surface in the presence of surface waves over the steady current by replicating it in a laboratory flume. The rough surface was modelled by using wooden ribs of square cross section extended across the whole channel width of flume. The instantaneous velocities at different positions in the flow field were measured by using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. The recorded velocities data were examined to investigate the coherent structures of turbulence near rough surface using the spatio-temporal averaging approach. Pre-multiplied velocity spectra, co-spectral, and coherency were evaluated in frequency domain at different vertical positions under different flow conditions. Length scales were determined to quantify the eddy size within the flow domain, and the anisotropy invariant maps were also obtained to characterize the anisotropic flow under different roughness conditions in wave-current flow cases. Results show increased correlation between velocity fluctuations in the large-scale low-frequency region due to the addition of surface waves, which accounts for the major part of Reynolds stress. Furthermore, turbulence dissipation in the near-bed region was found to be strongly dependent on roughness characteristics.},

abstract = {Environmental contours are often applied in probabilistic structural reliability analysis of marine structures in order to identify extreme environmental conditions that may give rise to extreme loads and responses. The perhaps most common way of establishing such environmental contours is based on the IFORM approximation (Inverse First Order Reliability Method), but recently an approach based on direct Monte Carlo simulations with importance sampling has been proposed as an alternative. Even though these contours should be used in the same way and address the same problem, there might be rather large differences between such contours in certain cases. In particular, the alternative contour method will always yield convex contours, whereas the traditional contours may be either convex or non-convex. In this paper, recent comparison studies are extended to include applications on simplified response examples. The contours are applied to simple response problems with known response surfaces in order to study how large the differences between the methods may be in terms of estimated maximum response and associated return periods. These case studies clearly illustrate the influence of the environmental contour method on the estimated extreme structural response. Whereas the different methods yield comparable results for some structural problems, they may give very different estimates of the extreme response for other. The estimated extreme responses and associated return periods from either method will also be compared to the correct extreme response, as estimated by simulation studies, for the desired return period. It is demonstrated that in certain cases, the estimates from some of the contour methods are highly conservative, whereas they in other cases might be very optimistic. The reason for these results are discussed and some requirements on the response functions for obtaining conservative estimates will be stated.},

abstract = {Maritime assets such as ships and offshore platforms are major investments. Their effective management is important. Their management plans should optimise asset availability, effective lifetime and functionality and reduce downtime for repairs. Together these aspects will improve safety, risk-management and cost-effectiveness. Difficult aspects relate to the wave loading on the asset and how to accurately model this both at any point in time, and over a period of time. This paper addresses recent developments in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technology that significantly improve the modelling of dynamic fluid environments, including the ocean wave environment for maritime applications. The improved modelling of the wave environment enables the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of a floating structure and the waves to be assessed. From this FSI and using finite element analysis techniques, the potential for non-linear failure behaviours in critical load-bearing structures can be predicted with greater confidence. Specific enhancements to SPH algorithms discussed herein are spatially-varied initial particle distributions, pressure correction, particle re-distributions, gravity initialisation, pressure sensors and translating active domains. Also discussed are practical aspects of the implementation that improve the ease of modelling real-world scenario such as contact interfaces, damping zones and wave making concepts. The connection between these SPH enhancements and existing features in commercial finite element analysis packages facilitate the implementation of the new assessment approach for maritime assets.},

abstract = {In physical model tests for highly reflective structures, one often encounters a problem of multiple reflections between the reflective structures and the wavemaker. Absorbing wavemakers can cancel the re-reflective waves by adjusting the paddle motion. In this paper, we propose a method to design the controller of the 2-D absorbing wavemaker system in the wave flume. Based on the first-order wavemaker theory, a frequency domain absorption transfer function is derived. Its time realization can be obtained by de- signing an infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filter, which is expected to approximate the absorption transfer function in the least- squares sense. A commonly used approach to determine the parameters of the IIR filter is applying the Taylor expansion to linearize the filter formulation and solving the linear least-squares problem. However, the result is not optimal because the linearization cha- nges the original objective function. To improve the approximation performance, we propose an iterative reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm and demonstrate that with the filters designed by this algorithm, the approximation errors can be reduced. Physical experiments are carried out with the designed controller. The results show that the system performs well for both regular and irregular waves.},

Liner shipping route choice is mainly contingent on fuel cost, which always contributes the major proportion of the ship's operating cost. Although many studies on this topic have been carried out, none are based on the fuel consumption forecast model designed by the advanced machine learning method. This paper provides a platform idea for selecting the optimal operating route for container ships to minimize fuel cost by using an asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) algorithm solution, in which the fuel consumption model for the route is estimated based on the deep-machine learning method. Five input variables are given in the model including average velocity, sailing time, ship's capacity, wind speed, and wind direction. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the model is 5.89%, indicating that the predictive result obtains a very high accuracy, close to 95%. The optimal model is thus applied in combination with ATSP to address the optimal solution for a certain route.},

Effects of the currents on the waves transformations are reported. Concerning regular waves, wave height and wave length changes were measured. The analysis of data shows an increase of the former and decrease of the latter. Wave steepness increment, related to the case without currents, shows a clear trend proportional to the ratio between the mean current velocity and the wave celerity. For what concerns irregular waves, spectral transformation was noticed. Results show drastic changes for higher frequencies compared to the lower ones. Due to adverse currents, the frequencies higher than the peak frequency increase energy before breaking. Such transfer of energy increases when the mean current velocity increases. For adverse flow that are strong enough, waves breaking occurs and energy dissipation is concentrated on higher frequencies. Zero moment wave height changes according to the spectral transformations. {\textcopyright} 2003 WIT Press.},

abstract = {Green water kinematics and dynamics due to wave impingements on a simplified geometry, fixed platform were experimentally investigated in a large, deep-water wave basin. Both plane focusing waves and random waves were employed in the generation of green water. The focusing wave condition was designed to create two consecutive plunging breaking waves with one impinging on the frontal vertical wall of the fixed platform, referred as wall impingement, and the other directly impinging on the deck surface, referred as deck impingement. The random wave condition was generated using the JONSWAP spectrum with a significant wave height approximately equal to the freeboard. A total of 179 green water events were collected in the random wave condition. By examining the green water events in random waves, three different flow types are categorized: collapse of overtopping wave, fall of bulk water, and breaking wave crest. The aerated flow velocity was measured using bubble image velocimetry, while the void fraction was measured using fiber optic reflectometry. For the plane focusing wave condition, measurements of impact pressure were synchronized with the flow velocity and void fraction measurements. The relationship between the peak pressures and the pressure rise times is examined. For the high-intensity impact in the deck impingement events, the peak pressures are observed to be proportional to the aeration levels. The maximum horizontal velocities in the green water events in random waves are well represented by the lognormal distribution. Ritter's solution is shown to quantitatively describe the green water velocity distributions under both the focusing wave condition and the random wave condition. A prediction equation for green water velocity distribution under random waves is proposed.},

The present paper describes recent efforts within the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) to improve experimental and numerical wave modelling and especially their combination. The ultimate objective is to be able to reproduce any wave condition from a basin or from sea in numerical tools and vice versa, including a sound treatment of basin effects, numerical effects and statistical variability. The aspects that are of importance in both types of wave modelling are first introduced, after which a number of examples of recent projects is discussed. It can be concluded that important steps were made towards linking experimental and numerical wave modelling, but there are some challenges common to all wave reproductions. Some future planned studies focussing on how to deal with them are discussed as well.},

Irregular head wave scenario at Fn = 0.25 is investigated and a controller design is implemented to ensure that the calculated RMS vertical acceleration values are decreased to tolerated levels in terms of motion sickness index. First, wave loads are obtained in the time domain by using strip theory, linear superposition technique, and the most common realization technique. Then, using a linear two-degree-of-freedom mathematical model, in which pitch and heave motions are considered together with the direct solution of convolution integrals, the uncontrolled motions and accelerations are obtained. Then, the linear matrix inequalities based on robust static output feedback controller are designed to mitigate the vertical acceleration of the ship. Finally, the results obtained with the robust static output feedback control design are presented in numerical simulation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.},

abstract = {For thermal mixed-convection flows, the Nusselt number is a function of Reynolds number, Grashof number and the angle between the forced- and natural-convection directions. We consider flow over a heated cylinder for which there is no universal correlation that accurately predicts Nusselt number as a function of these parameters, especially in opposing-convection flows, where the natural convection is against the forced convection. Here, we revisit this classical problem by employing modern tools from machine learning to develop a general multi-fidelity framework for constructing a stochastic response surface for the Nusselt number. In particular, we combine previously developed experimental correlations (low-fidelity model) with direct numerical simulations (high-fidelity model) using Gaussian process regression and autoregressive stochastic schemes. In this framework the high-fidelity model is sampled only a few times, while the inexpensive empirical correlation is sampled at a very high rate. We obtain the mean Nusselt number directly from the stochastic multi-fidelity response surface, and we also propose an improved correlation. This new correlation seems to be consistent with the physics of this problem as we correct the vectorial addition of forced and natural convection with a pre-factor that weighs differently the forced convection. This, in turn, results in a new definition of the effective Reynolds number, hence accounting for the 'incomplete similarity' between mixed convection and forced convection. In addition, due to the probabilistic construction, we can quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions. This information-fusion framework is useful for elucidating the physics of the flow, especially in cases where anomalous transport or interesting dynamics may be revealed by contrasting the variable fidelity across the models. While in this paper we focus on the thermal mixed convection, the multi-fidelity framework provides a new paradigm that could be used in many different contexts in fluid mechanics including heat and mass transport, but also in combining various levels of fidelity of models of turbulent flows.},

abstract = {We develop a fast multi-fidelity modeling method for very complex correlations between high- and low-fidelity data by working in modal space to extract the proper correlation function. We apply this method to infer the amplitude of motion of a flexible marine riser in cross-flow, subject to vortex-induced vibrations (VIV). VIV are driven by an absolute instability in the flow, which imposes a frequency (Strouhal) law that requires a matching with the impedance of the structure; this matching is easily achieved because of the rapid parametric variation of the added mass force. As a result, the wavenumber of the riser spatial response is within narrow bands of uncertainty. Hence, an error in wavenumber prediction can cause significant phase-related errors in the shape of the amplitude of response along the riser, rendering correlation between low- and high-fidelity data very complex. Working in modal space as outlined herein, dense data from low-fidelity data, provided by the semi-empirical computer code VIVA, can correlate in modal space with few high-fidelity data, obtained from experiments or fully-resolved CFD simulations, to correct both phase and amplitude and provide predictions that agree very well overall with the correct shape of the amplitude response. We also quantify the uncertainty in the prediction using Bayesian modeling and exploit this uncertainty to formulate an active learning strategy for the best possible location of the sensors providing the high fidelity measurements.},

Experimental data, based on a time-resolved particle image velocimetry technique and on a novel free-surface tracking method [M. Miozzi, "Particle image velocimetry using feature tracking and Delaunay tessellation," in Proceedings of the 12th International Symposium on Applications of Laser Techniques to Fluid Mechanics (2004)], are used to characterize the details of the flip-through dynamics while wave loads are computed by integrating the experimental pressure distributions. Three different flip-through modes are observed and studied in dependence on the amount and modes of air trapping. No air entrapment characterizes a "mode (a) flip-through," engulfment of a single, well-formed air bubble is typical of a "mode (b)" event, while the generation of a fine-scale air-water mixing occurs for a "mode (c)" event. Upward accelerations of the flip-through jet exceeding 1500g have been measured and the generation/collapse process of a small air cavity is described in conjunction with the available pressure time histories. Predictions of the vertical pressure distributions made with the pressure-impulse model of Cooker and Peregrine [M. J. Cooker and D. H.

Two asymptotic regimes are identified, characterized by a new dimensionless number : when the gas cushioning is weak, the jet is formed after a sequence of bubbles are entrapped and the jet speed is mostly selected by the Reynolds number of the impact. On the other hand, when the air cushioning is important, the lubrication of the gas beneath the drop and the liquid film controls the dynamics, leading to a single bubble entrapment and a weaker jet velocity.},

abstract = {The primary objective of this paper is to provide a detailed confirmation of the validity of potential-flow theory for describing steep gravity waves produced in an experimental tank. Very high-resolution computations are carried out which use a refined mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian solution scheme under the assumptions of potential flow. The numerical results for a plunging breaker produced by a programmed piston-type wavemaker are found to be in excellent agreement with tank measurements up to and including overturning. The calculated free-surface elevations are almost indistinguishable from measured profiles, even close to where the wave plunges. The horizontal and vertical water-particle velocities measured with a laser anemometer throughout the water depth at two longitudinal stations are also well predicted by the theory. In contrast to the fully nonlinear theory, predictions based on linearized theory become poorer as the wave packet moves down the tank.

abstract = {Slamming events consisting of an air pocket which is entrapped between a free-surface wave and a rigid structure are considered. This type of impacts occurs during sloshing at a high filling level and as breaking waves impact on sea walls. The air pressure inside this type of air pockets is nearly uniform in space and oscillates in time qualitatively like the free oscillations of a mass-spring system. New analytical natural-frequency formulas are derived for an entrapped air pocket on a vertical wall and for the entrapped air pocket at the upper corner of a sloshing tank. The formulas are verified through comparison with the boundary element method. A comparison between the new analytical formula for entrapped air pockets at the upper corner of a sloshing tank and experiments shows good agreement. The new analytical formula for the entrapped air pocket at a vertical wall is compared with experiments and an existing formula by Topliss et al. (1993). None of the analytical formulas could accurately estimate the natural frequency for this problem. Improved results were obtained by a boundary element method when the geometry of the air pocket and the free surface were fitted accurately. This work shows that the natural frequency is sensitive to both the assumed shape of the air pocket and the shape of the free surface outside the air pocket. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This Paper Examines The Problem Of The Survival Of Salter'S Duck Wave-Energy Device In Extreme Waves, Both Experimentally In A Narrow Tank At Edinburgh University And Theoretically, Using Programs Originally Designed To Study Nonlinear Ship Motions (Vinje & Brevig 1981). Both Approaches Are Essentially Two-Dimensional, Corresponding To Waves Normally Incident Upon The Duck String, And Comparison Of The Two Sets Of Results For A Duck On A Fixed Axis Shows Good Agreement.236 with a corresponding theoretical wave has been made by Brevig et al. (1981), where the agreement between the time progression of the two waves is fair, the differences being due to the method of generation of the experimental wave differing from the sinusoidal wave used as the initial condition for the theoretical wave. In this paper we present more realistic initial conditions suggested by the start of the photograph sequence shown in figure 4. Here the duck has been positioned in the water at the nominal breaking point of the wave (as if the duck were absent) and held on a fixed axis. The sequence shown in figure 4 is in fact made up from separate runs of the wave, taking one photograph per run. This requires good repeatability of the wave profile, which is demonstrated by comparing the photographs of figure 5 where three separate runs are photographed at a particular instant.From a series of extensive tests undertaken at the University of Edinburgh in 1978 (see Edinburgh Wave Power Project 19786) we know that an undamped duck on a rigid axis will have higher angular velocities, and consequently greater angular displacements than those of ducks on a compliant axis. Therefore we regard the undamped duck on a rigid axis as a good check for the theory.Figure 6 presents measurements of the wave profile without the duck, and the forces on the axis in the heave-and-surge direction. The sign convention is positive upwards for heave, positive opposite the wave direction for surge, and positive anticlockwise for nod.Before we start the time-stepping we need to provide the following initial conditions: wave elevation and velocity potential on the free surface, and position and velocity of the body. In principle it should be possible to start the body from rest in locally calm water with an incident wave some distance from the body; in practice this would require prohibitive amounts of computer storage and time to run a wave break. We therefore obtain initial conditions from the photographs just before the wave break as described below.Figure 7 shows theoretical results for initial conditions as follows: the centre of gravity, mass and moment of inertia are taken from experimental data; the initial displacement and velocity is taken from the photographs ((0 = 0); behind the duck the wave elevation and velocity potential are taken to be zero; the incident wave is given from linear theory for deep water waves (wavelength 110 m, crest-to-trough height 20 m and water depth 60 m, corresponding closely to the experimental wave); at distances greater than ¾ wavelength from the duck the elevation and velocity potential on the free surface is decreased linearly with distance to zero at 5/4 wavelengths from the duck. Thus we are able to apply periodic boundary conditions over this control volume. Returning to figure 7, we see that the duck capsizes fully during the sequence, and the numerical solution breaks down because the duck submerges. Comparison with the sequence of photographs of figure 4 shows that the duck velocities and positions look correct, but the wave profile generated by the above initial conditions is incorrect and does not lead to the spilling breaker seen in the experiments, but rather simulates duck capsize in large but non-breaking waves. Furthermore, the sharp corners in the free surface are almost certainly due to the numerical scheme used, and more especially to the placing of the point of intersection of the body and the free surface.We refine the initial conditions as shown in figure 8, where the control volume length is increased to 7/4 wavelengths, and the linear decrease is applied both behind and in. {\textcopyright} 1982, Cambridge University Press.

The requirements of this standard focus on reaching the intended safety level in an economic way. Where the intended safety level could have been reached in several ways, the requirements of this standard have in general been aligned with requirements of other international standards, in particular with the IEC 61400 series of standards.

abstract = {Long-crested waves are typically used in the design of offshore structures. However, the corresponding statistics, kinematics and loading are significantly different in short-crested waves and up to date, there is no state-of-the-art methodology to apply short-crested models instead. The objective of the “ShortCresT” Joint Industry Project was to take into account short-crestedness in the design of offshore structures against extreme waves based on a good description of their spectral characteristics, statistics, kinematics, breaking and loading and to deliver (empirical) design recommendations and methods. This paper gives an overview of the findings of ShorTCresT regarding wave crest and height distributions, a comparison of basin and field data, the role of wave breaking, the most realistic directional model, hindcast models as well as the related platform loading.},

abstract = {<p>The performance of non-intrusive instruments, such as acoustic profilers and cameras, to describe the wave-induced flow processes over maritime dike crest was investigated in experiments carried out at the University of Bologna. Direct and derived measurements from the acoustic probes deployed along the structure crest were discussed in relation to the observed backscatter rates. Image processing was implemented by means of clustering algorithm, in order to detect the free surface during overtopping events and characterize wave front propagation over the dike crest. UVP data were processed to indirectly derive flow depths and overtopping rates and compare them with the direct measurements in order to assess the measurement reliability and discuss their limits. Individual overtopping volume distribution as obtained by UVP data were estimated and compared with well-consolidated formulations, showing a good agreement. Finally, suggestions for an appropriate use of non-intrusive instruments to characterize a shallow, transient and aerated flow were provided, such as the control of the artificial seeding density, the use of a bi-static UVP configuration and adjustments to light exposure.</p>},

abstract = {The present study provides an extensive analysis on the hydrodynamics induced by a vertical slender pile under wave action. The authors carried out the study both experimentally and numerically, thus enabling a deep understanding of the flow physics. The experiments took place at a wave flume of the Universit{\`{a}} Politecnica delle Marche. Two different experimental campaigns were performed: In the former one, a mobile bed model was realized with the aims to study both the scour process and the hydrodynamics around the cylinder; in the latter one, the seabed was rigid in order to make undisturbed optical measurements, providing a deeper analysis of the hydrodynamics. The numerical investigation was made by performing a direct numerical simulation. A second order numerical discretization, both in time and in space, was used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations while a volume of fluid (VOF) approach was adopted for tracking the free surface. The comparison between experimental and numerical results is provided in terms of velocity, pressure distributions around the cylinder, and total force on it. The analysis of the pressure gradient was used to evaluate the generation and evolution of vortices around the cylinder. Finally, the relation between scour and bed shear stresses due to the structure of the vortex pattern around the pile was assessed. It is worth noting that the physical understanding of this last analysis was enabled by the combined use of experimental data on scour and numerical data on the flow pattern.},

abstract = {The aerodynamics of hovering flight in a hawkmoth (Manduca sexta) are examined using a computational modelling approach which combines a low-fidelity blade-element model with a high-fidelity Navier-Stokes-based flow solver. The focus of the study is on understanding the optimality of the hawkmoth-inpired wingstrokes with respect to lift generation and power consumption. The approach employs a tight coupling between the computational models and experiments; the Navier-Stokes model is validated against experiments, and the blade-element model is calibrated with the data from the Navier-Stokes modelling. In the first part of the study, blade-element and Navier-Stokes modelling are used concurrently to assess the predictive capabilities of the blade-element model. Comparisons between the two modelling approaches also shed insights into specific flow features and mechanisms that are lacking in the lower-fidelity model. Subsequently, we use blade-element modelling to explore a large kinematic parameter space of the flapping wing, and Navier-Stokes modelling is used to assess the performance of the wing-stroke identified as optimal by the blade-element parameter survey. This multi-fidelity optimization study indicates that even within a parameter space constrained by the animal's natural flapping amplitude and frequency, it is relatively easy to synthesize a wing stroke that exceeds the aerodynamic performance of the hawkmoth wing stroke. Within the prescribed constraints, the optimal wing stroke closely approximates the condition of normal hover, and the implications of these findings on hawkmoth flight capabilities as well as on the issue of biomimetic versus bioinspired design of flapping wing micro-aerial vehicles, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

The motion is governed by the classical, incompressible, two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation. The numerical modeling of this two-phase flow is based on a piecewise linear version of the volume of fluid method. Capillary effects are taken into account such as a nonisotropic stress tensor concentrated near the interface. Results concerning the time evolution of liquid-gas interface and velocity field are given for short waves, showing bow an initial steep wave undergoes breaking and successive splash-up cycles. Breaking processes including overturning, splash-up and gas entrainment, and breaking induced vortex-like motion beneath the surface and energy dissipation, are presented and discussed. It is found that strong vorticities are generated during the breaking process, and that more than 80% of the total pre-breaking wave energy is dissipated within three wave periods. The numerical results are compared with some laboratory measurements, and a favorable agreement is found. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

Further, the plane wave integral representation of Bessel and Hankel functions are applied to study the influence of porous structure in damping the far-field wave energy. In order to examine the effect of various physical parameters, heave force exerted on the membrane, deflection of the membrane, reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes, flow distribution around the structure and far-field energy dissipation are computed and analyzed for three different edge conditions such as (i) free edge, (ii) moored edge and (iii) clamped edge. The study reveals that the surface wave amplitude on the lee side of the structure decreases significantly in the presence of floating porous elastic membrane. Moreover, the membrane having clamped edge dissipates more wave energy as compared to that for moored and free edge conditions.},

The goal of the parameter identification approach is the estimation of the AD coefficients in real-time by using a method based on a bank of state estimators, which in turn are based on a spatial-discrete version of the AD equation. In order to test the approach with real data, laboratory experiments of consecutive green water events on a fixed structure were performed. Such events were generated with regular waves of different steepness in a wave flume by employing high-speed video to capture flow evolution. Time series of water elevations were obtained at several positions over the deck to perform the parameter identification and to validate the present approach. Results suggested that the present approach allowed capturing acceptably the evolution of consecutive events even when considering constant AD parameters. Maximum elevations in each event as well as their time of occurrence were well approximated, which is an advantage against traditional analytical methods.},

abstract = {In order to extend the operational weather window for marine vessels under Dynamic Positioning (DP) control, a novel sea state identification method with multi-layer classifiers is proposed in this paper. Due to the distinction of system responses for various sea states, four motion signals including surge, sway, roll and yaw are adopted for classification purpose. Firstly, preprocessing techniques, like filtration and k-means clustering are performed to the raw data to filter out the “corrupted” low frequency (LF) information and generate the band-pass filter bank. Then, the processed data is decomposed into 20 categories via Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), filter bank method and wavelet transform and 11 statistical features are extracted for each category. Subsequently, Max-relevance Min-redundancy (mRMR) method helps to select salient features with best trade-off between relevance and redundancy. With these selected features, a newly developed three-layer classification structure with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Random Forest (RF) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based combination classifiers is proposed to derive the current sea state. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed identification system can achieve satisfactory classification accuracy. Moreover, the multi-layer classifier outperforms single layer classifier and can rapidly classify the sea state in real-time implementation.},

@article{Schaffer1994,
abstract = {Through the last decade the theory for second-order irregular wave generation was developed within the framework of Stokes wave theory. This pioneering work, however, is not fully consistent. Furthermore, due to the extensive algebra involved, the derived transfer functions appear in an unnecessarily complicated form. The present paper develops the full second-order wavemaker theory (including superharmonics as well as subharmonics) valid for rotational as well as translatory wave board motion. The primary goal is to obtain the second-order motion of the wave paddle required in order to get a spatially homogeneous wave field correct to second order, i.e. in order to suppress spurious free-wave generation. In addition to the transfer functions developed in the line of references on which the present work is based, some new terms evolve. These are related to the first-order evanescent modes and accordingly they are significant when the wave board motion makes a poor fit to the velocity profile of the desired progressive wave component. This is, for example, the case for the high-frequency part of a primary wave spectrum when using a piston-type wavemaker. The transfer functions are given in a relatively simple form by which the computational effort is reduced substantially. This enhances the practical computation of second-order wavemaker control signals for irregular waves, and no narrow band assumption is needed. The software is conveniently included in a PC-based wave generation system-the DHI Wave Synthesizer. The validity of the theory is demonstrated for a piston type wavemaker in a number of laboratory wave experiments for regular waves, wave groups and irregular waves. 1. INTRODUCTION First-order wavemaker theory corresponding to linearized Stokes theory has long been well established (Havelock, 1929; Biesel, 1951; Ursell et al., 1960; and others; cf. the review by Svendsen, 1985) and we devote this introduction to second-order theories of wave generation. The first step towards the development of wavemaker theory is of course the knowledge of the underlying wave theory. Already in 1847 Stokes gave results for regular waves in terms of a perturbation series using the wave steepness as the small ordering parameter. For regular waves only the sum frequencies appear (since the difference frequencies vanish) and Stokes found the resulting superharmonics. Presumably the first approach to second-order wavemaker theory was given by Fontanet (1961) for regular waves. Using a Lagrangian description he found the spurious superharmonics generated by a purely sinusoidal oscillation of the wave board and gave directions as how to suppress these by adding a superharmonic component to the wavemaker control signal. Hudspeth and Sulisz (1991) derived the complete second-order Eulerian theory waves generated by a monochromatic wave paddle motion with special emphasis on Stokes drift and return flow in wave flumes; see also Sulisz and Hudspeth (1993).

To accurately train surrogate models, simulation data provided by two computational frameworks are leveraged, predicting hydrodynamic and solid mechanics quantities of interest. Each framework provides data at low- and high-fidelity levels through a multiresolution approach for the hydrodynamic quantities (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes at high and low resolutions), and a multifidelity approach for the solid mechanics predictions (full three-dimensional and a simple beam). The framework is demonstrated through the design of a complex supercavitating hydrofoil, but the method is generally applicable to the design of a complex physical system under uncertainty.},

abstract = {With the development of computer applications in ship design, optimization, as a powerful approach, has been widely used in the design and analysis process. However, the running time, which often varies from several weeks to months in the current computing environment, has been a bottleneck problem for optimization applications, particularly in the structural design of ships. To speed up the optimization process and adjust the complex design environment, ship designers usually rely on their personal experience to assist the design work. However, traditional experience, which largely depends on the designer's personal skills, often makes the design quality very sensitive to the experience and decreases the robustness of the final design. This paper proposes a new machine-learning-based ship design optimization approach, which uses machine learning as an effective tool to give direction to optimization and improves the adaptability of optimization to the dynamic design environment. The natural human learning process is introduced into the optimization procedure to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Q-learning, as an approach of reinforcement learning, is utilized to realize the learning function in the optimization process. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization method, multi-agent system, and CAE software are used to build an integrated optimization system. A bulk carrier structural design optimization was performed as a case study to evaluate the suitability of this method for real-world application. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Hattori1994a,
abstract = {Laboratory experiments were conducted to improve our understanding of the physics and characteristics of impact pressures due to collisions of breaking waves against a vertical wall. Measurements of impact wave pressures were performed simultaneously with observation of high-speed video pictures of the violent wave motion at the collision. The physics and characteristics of the impact pressure significantly depend on the colliding conditions of breaking waves. These were studied for the following colliding conditions: flip-through, collision of the vertical wave front, and plunging wave collision. When a small amount of air is entrapped between the breaking wave and the wall at the collision, the impact pressure increases considerably. The highest pressure, of very short duration, is observed when a vertical wave front strikes the wall while trapping a small amount of air in the form of either bubbles or a thin lens-shaped pocket. The impulsive pressure, occurring in the vicinity of the still water level, is transmitted downwards through the water body with the sound velocity. The larger the amount of the entrapped air at impact of the plunging breakers, the lower the magnitude and the longer the rise or compression time of the impact pressures. When plunging and curling of the breaking wave develop well, a thick air pocket is trapped, and damped pressure oscillations, due to the air pocket pulsation, appear immediately after the peak of the impact pressure. The oscillation frequencies are lower the greater the amount of entrapped air, and are almost equal to the resonant frequency of pulsating air pockets. The damping mechanisms, however, still remain unknown. Agreements between the measured and predicted oscillation frequencies suggest that adiabatic processes of the air pocket play an essential role in the physics of high impact pressure. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamical analysis and control synthesis for fractional-order pitch-roll system of marine vessels under regular waves. Suppression of the effects of roll and pitch motions is critical in improving maneuverability and stability of marine vessels with ensuring the safety of cargo and comfort to sailors. The pitch-roll mode shows complex behaviours such as period-2 motion, symmetry-breaking, torus attractor, and resonance depending on initial conditions, natural frequencies, wave frequencies, and wave amplitudes. Specifically, the nonlinear behaviours are characterized by phase portraits, bifurcation diagrams, and stability analysis. The nonlinear vibration patterns are observed even under regular waves because the pitch-roll motions are strongly coupled with two perpendicular directions. To secure the upright position of the vessels in heavy weather, adaptive fractional-order sliding mode control (AFOSMC) scheme has been employed to effectively regulate pitch-roll modes against extreme sea states. The closed stability of the ship pitch-roll system has been guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations have been extensively conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms. To design more comfortable and safe vessels, this study presents pitch-roll resonance eliminations, stabilization and the challenges associated with robust vessel design.},

abstract = {The water-shipping problem is modelled in a two-dimensional framework and studied experimentally and numerically for the case of a fixed barge-shaped structure. The analysis represents the second step of the research discussed in Greco et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 525, 2005, p. 309). The numerical investigation is performed by using both a boundary element method and a domain-decomposition strategy. The model tests highlight the occurrence of dam-breaking-type water on deck, (a) with and (b) without an initial plunging phase, and (c) an unusual type of water shipping connected with blunt water-deck impacts here called a hammer-fist type event never documented before. Cases (a) and (c) are connected with the most severe events and the related features and green-water loads are discussed in detail. A parametric analysis of water-on-deck phenomena has also been carried out in terms of the local incoming waves and bow flow features. We classify such phenomena in a systematic way to provide a basis for further investigations of water-on-deck events. The severity of (a)-type water-on-deck events is analysed in terms of initial cavity area and water-front velocity along the deck. The former increases as the square power of the modified incoming-wave (front-crest) steepness while the latter scales with its square-root. The two-dimensional investigation gives useful quantitative information in terms of water-front velocity for comparison with three-dimensional water-on-deck experiments on fixed bow models interacting with wave packets. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Green water has a significant effect on safety and on structural strength of an FPSO. Green water mostly occurs at the bow of an FPSO because of the weathervaning capability. When the waves, current and wind are not co-directional, it can occur that waves are coming in on the side of the FPSO. When designing an FPSO for a benign environment, classification society rules are available to determine the measures which have to be considered against green water along the side. When the probability of green water and the freeboard exceedance along the side are actually known, no potentially unnecessary measures, implied by classification society regulations, have to be implemented on the FPSO. This study dealt with the probability of green water occurrence and most probable maximum freeboard exceedance along the side of the Petrojarl 1. Specifically, the effect of the various ship motions and the free surface elevation on the probability of green water are researched. The probability of green water occurring along the side of the Petrojarl 1 is analysed with linear 3D diffraction theory. The analysis is performed for the conditions in which the vessel will be operating. The probability is based both on the second order Forristall distributionand the linear Rayleigh distribution to determine the effect of the distribution on the probability of green water occurrence, because the Forristall distribution accounts for the second order wave effects in the incoming wave. The free surface elevation along the side of the FPSO under a certain relative wave angle proved to be of great importance. Therefore the free surface elevation is validated with measurements performed at MARIN for the free surface elevation along a plate. Finally, the relative wave angle also affects the probability of green water. This study dealt with the influence of the relative wave angle for the green water probability along the side of the Petrojarl 1.},

These control signals produce waves that are within 2% of stream function theory solutions for the fundamental harmonic component, and within 10% for the second-order harmonic component.

The simulations are conducted using a newly developed flow model that takes into account air compression in violent free–surface phenomena. Regular Equivalent Design Wave and Response Conditioned Wave approaches are used and compared in terms of loads exerted on the deck structure and required computational resources. Some differences in loads are found between the methods, whilst similar computational resources are required. The Regular Equivalent Design Wave gives larger loads, making it a safer choice. However, the Response Conditioned Wave takes into account the relevant ocean wave conditions as well as the response of the ship, resulting in smaller loads which would enable smaller structural scantlings and cost savings.},

More recently, applications ranging from the transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in LNG carriers to the harvesting of wave energy with oscillating wave surge converters have led to renewed interest in the topic. The main reason for this renewed interest is that the extreme impact pressures generated during slamming can affect the integrity of the structures involved. Slamming fluid mechanics is challenging to describe, as much from an experimental viewpoint as from a numerical viewpoint, because of the large span of spatial and temporal scales involved. Even the physical mechanisms of slamming are challenging: What physical phenomena must be included in slamming models? An important issue deals with the practical modeling of slamming: Are there any simple models available? Are numerical models viable? What are the consequences for the design of structures? This article describes the loading processes involved in slamming, offers state-of-the-art results, and highlights unresolved issues worthy of further research.},

Wave trains were generated with different wavelengths and heights. High-speed video was employed to capture details of the green water flow and image-based methods were used to extract water elevation data for the spatial and temporal analysis. A preliminary evaluation of an engineering convolution approach for capturing the water-on-deck elevations generated by the wave trains is also included. The experimental results were systematically carried out to allow the study of the effect of the wave trains on freeboard exceedance, the distribution of water on the deck, and the green water evolution. The convolution approach reproduced adequately the water elevations in time and space for all the study cases.

The modes were generally composed of a swell system emanating from the most intense storm region and local wind-seas. The peak systems were consistently young, meaning actively forced by winds, when the storms were close. During the peaks of the most intense passages—Chaba at the northern mooring and Megi at the southern—the bimodal seas coalesced.

abstract = {This paper presents a series of numerical analyses performed with the potential theory-based Green Water engineer tool KINEMA3. KINEMA3 was designed to predict wave-induced impact loads on FPSOs in steep irregular waves, and for use in design load analysis. The purpose of the study presented herein is to validate KINEMA3 green water (deck overtopping) predictions in nonlinear irregular waves with results from model tests performed at the TPN (Tanque de Provas Num{\'{e}}rico) laboratory at the University of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. Comparisons are made for a selection of irregular wave cases, for two choices of anchoring conditions (free floating vessel and fixed vessel) and for three wave headings (180°, 225° and 270°: head, quartering and beam seas, respectively). KINEMA3 statistical green water predictions present a general good agreement with observations from the TPN model tests for all wave cases, headings and mooring conditions. Overall, observed trends for occurrence of green water and standard deviation/maximum of relative wave height are successfully reproduced by KINEMA3. In agreement with model test results, it is predicted that green water occurs more frequently for a free floating vessel and for beam seas. Additional comparisons between KINEMA3 predictions using different FPSO panel models (low-order and high-order models) present negligible differences with respect to green water estimates. The results presented herein demonstrate the robustness of the tool towards the prediction of green water for variable wave headings and sea states, and highlight the capability of KINEMA3 to be employed as an engineering-like tool for fast and multiple estimates of green water in early design studies.

abstract = {A drop hitting a solid surface can deposit, bounce, or splash. Splashing arises from the breakup of a fine liquid sheet that is ejected radially along the substrate. Bouncing and deposition depend crucially on the wetting properties of the substrate. In this review, we focus on recent experimental and theoretical studies, which aim at unraveling the underlying physics, characterized by the delicate interplay of not only liquid inertia, viscosity, and surface tension, but also the surrounding gas. The gas cushions the initial contact; it is entrapped in a central microbubble on the substrate; and it promotes the so-called corona splash, by lifting the lamella away from the solid. Particular attention is paid to the influence of surface roughness, natural or engineered to enhance repellency, relevant in many applications.},

abstract = {Multi-fidelity modelling enables accurate inference of quantities of interest by synergistically combining realizations of low-cost/low-fidelity models with a small set of high-fidelity observations. This is particularly effective when the low-and high-fidelity models exhibit strong correlations, and can lead to significant computational gains over approaches that solely rely on high-fidelity models. However, in many cases of practical interest, low-fidelity models can only be well correlated to their high-fidelity counterparts for a specific range of input parameters, and potentially return wrong trends and erroneous predictions if probed outside of their validity regime. Here we put forth a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian process regression and nonlinear autoregressive schemes that is capable of learning complex nonlinear and space-dependent crosscorrelations between models of variable fidelity, and can effectively safeguard against low-fidelity models that provide wrong trends. This introduces a new class of multi-fidelity information fusion algorithms that provide a fundamental extension to the existing linear autoregressive methodologies, while still maintaining the same algorithmic complexity and overall computational cost. The performance of the proposed methods is tested in several benchmark problems involving both synthetic and real multifidelity datasets from computational fluid dynamics simulations.},

Poor correlation was found between the semi-empirical equations at present used to estimate wave impact pressures and the prototype data obtained during this investigation. A rational expression for the estimation of wave impact pressures on coastal structures has thus been derived based on the local wave parameters at impact and includes a coefficient related to the percentage of air entrained in the incident wave. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {When a droplet impacts a solid surface, the entrapment of a submillimeter-sized bubble and the emission of a high speed jet can be observed at low impact velocities. In this work, we show that bubble entrapment occurs only on sufficiently hydrophobic surfaces within a narrow range of impact velocities. The bubble is entrapped on hydrophobic surfaces, whereas it is trapped into the top of the droplet on superhydrophobic surfaces. The collapse of the air cavity formed during droplet impact, which is dominated by inertia and influenced by surface wettability, is the cause of the bubble entrapment. The velocity of liquid jets emitted after cavity collapse for drop impact with and without bubble entrapment scales with their sizes according to different power laws, which is explained by simple scaling analyses.},

abstract = {The autonomous navigation of smart ships needs to meet their huge inertia and obey existing complex rules. A smart ship has to realise autonomous driving instead of manual operation, which consists of path planning and controlling. Toward to this goal, this research proposes a path planning and manipulating approach based on Q-learning, which can drive a cargo ship by itself without requiring any input from human experiences. At the very beginning, a ship is modelled with the Nomoto model in a simulation waterway. Then, distances, obstacles and prohibited areas are regularized as rewards or punishments, which are used to judge the performance, or manipulation decisions of the ship. Subsequently, Q-learning is introduced to learn the action–reward model and the learning outcome is used to manipulate the ship's movement. By chasing higher reward values, the ship can find an appropriate path or navigation strategies by itself. After a sufficient number of rounds of training, a convincing path and manipulating strategies will likely be produced. By comparing the proposed approach with the existing methods, it is shown that this approach is more effective in self-learning and continuous optimisation, and therefore closer to human manoeuvring.},

abstract = {Flooding of a ship's deck (greenwater) or within its internal compartments can severely restrict the operational ability of the vessel, and the safety of its cargo. In severe circumstances such as those produced by freak waves or hull damage, the vessel can become unstable causing it to sink and/or capsize. The flows produced by such events tend to be highly dynamic, with large amounts of free surface deformation. For this reason, SPH is a valuable method for predicting the physics of such flows. In this paper, SPH is used to predict fluid behaviour for two different flooding scenarios. The first is the interaction between a vessel (represented by a rigid body) and undulating travelling waves. The predicted water heights on the deck are compared to experimental results in [1]. The second is the transient flooding behaviour that occurs during, and immediately after a side collision between two vessels. Water heights are measured close to the point of impact within the vessel. The measurements are compared to experimental results in [2]. {\textcopyright} 2010 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the difference in the preformance of wedge shaped plunger-type wavemakers with different anges. The angle that were used were 25, 35 and 45 degrees. The study was carried out using the numerical method; unstructured finite volume method. A very good presentation is given detailing the validation and verifictation process of the numerical model. This isn't included in this review, but should be reffered to again when investigating numerical models with a better understanding of numerical models. - The preformance of the three different wavemakers was assest by comparing the wave height and the fluctuations in the asymmetry of the wave. The asymmetries considered are the horizontal asymmetry which is defined as the ratio of the crest height from the still water level to the wave height, and the vertical asymmetry, defined as; the ratio of the "horizontal distance form the crest to the zero crossing in front of and behind the crest". The author reports that as its would be expected, form basic Galvin theory, as the angle of the wedge increase so does the wave height. Since, as similar to the basis of Galvin theory, as the amount of water dissplaced increase then so does the wave height. This effect is much more evident for frequency motion. A limitation to the numerical model is that close to breaking point over damping occurs, this is because of the insufficient resolution in the grid. - Fluctuations occur for both aysmmetries for all three wedge angles, however it is evident that the fluctuations increase with increasing wedge angle, though this is certianly more significent in the vertical asymmetry. The fluctuations seem to be greater for lower motion frequecies, and also increase for greater wavemaker amplitude. Though each wedge does have a motion frequency where a minimal amount of fluctuation occurs. The author noted that when a very good agreement was found when comparing the averaged horizontal asymmetries of all wedges with the horizontal asymmetries of the second-order Stoke approximation, with any decrepencies being attributed to the over damping close to breaking point.},

abstract = {The slamming of waves on the lower deck of large volume offshore platforms has received increased attention over recent years. For many existing platforms, the problem of insufficient air-gap clearance has become more acute of late due to more extreme weather conditions than was used in their original design basis and/or due to issues such as subsidence of gravity based structures. To investigate this problem, MARINTEK's Wave Impact Loads JIP has, in one of its sub-tasks, focused towards an idealised model test setup of a rectangular block in regular waves. The block is fixed at a distance h above the calm water line. Both 2D and 3D model test experiments of the block in regular waves have been carried out in Phase 1 of the JIP (2008). This paper considers results from the 2D model test setup, and compares the measured vertical loading on the deck against two simple potential theory based methods (Baarholm, OMAE 2009-79560) and against results from a CFD code (STAR-CCM+). The results demonstrate that a second impact event closely following a first impact event can have a much flatter free-surface profile (and stronger water entry force) as a result of its interaction with the (deck) diffracted wave from the first impact event. The importance of resolving this diffracted wave in the CFD analysis is demonstrated. The paper concludes that for isolated impact events the simple potential flow based models, which do not consider the influence of one impact event on another, are adequate to predict the vertical loading on the deck. However, from a design basis criteria, if there is the strong likelihood of steep wave groupings resulting in closely following wave-in-deck impact events, then the presented simple methods may be non-conservative, and a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis or model test may be advisable to predict the vertical wave-in-deck loading. However the horizontal loading was significantly under-predicted in the CFD analysis compared to the measurements, so more work still needs to be done in this respect.

This can cause damage to the sensitive equ$\sim$ment at the bow, like the fluid swivel, piping, turret structure and chemical stores.

Based on a series of mode/ tests this paper presents an orientation into the various aspects which play a role in the green water loading on FPSO units. First the occurring phenomena are described. Second the effect of the environmental conditions, such as the wave height, wave period and current velocity, are highlighted. Finally several design aspects are considered. The influence of the bow shape, the position of the equipment on the deck and the shape of breakwaters will be discussed.},

abstract = {During the ADIOS EU funded program, the total atmospheric deposition of metals (Al, Cd, Zn and Pb) and elements of biogeochemical interest (Fe, P) were collected monthly during one year (June 01/May 02) at nine coastal sampling sites around the Mediterranean Sea. In order to avoid bias in assessing the spatial and temporal variability, the sampling was performed using the same protocol and the same schedule, with a centralized location for preparation and samples analysis. The highest fluxes were found for Al and Fe (1004 and 665 kg km- 2 yr- 1 respectively), with these fluxes being two times higher in the western basin than in the eastern one, due to the occurrence of strong Saharan dust fall. The comparison of Al fluxes with previous data for the northwest Mediterranean over the past two decades underlines the very high variability, precluding any assessment of spatial trends from our study. The mean phosphorus flux was 33 kg km- 2 yr- 1, with a possible slight decrease from the western/central basin to the eastern one. Zinc fluxes were slightly higher in the western basin than in the eastern one (12.1 and 7.7 kg km- 2 yr- 1 respectively). Lead fluxes were identical in both basins, at 1.46 kg km- 2 yr- 1, but gradients within the basins indicated higher fluxes in the south of the western basin and in the north of the eastern one. A decreasing trend was observed over the past two decades for the northwestern basin, linked to reduction in the use of unleaded gasoline in the western European countries. For cadmium, the fluxes were of the same order of magnitude in both basins, with an average value of 0.037 kg km- 2 yr- 1, and with no clearly-decreasing trend over the past 20 years. Using the element-to-Al ratio in Saharan dust, the non-crustal contribution to the total atmospheric deposition was on average 11, 70, 81, 88, and 96% for Fe, P, Pb, Zn and Cd respectively. Fe and Al were well correlated, with the Fe/Al ratio for western sites being typical of the Saharan end-member already defined in the western basin, but slightly higher in the eastern one, probably due to a variation in the composition of the source of the Saharan dust. Biogeochemical response to atmospheric inputs was considered at the scale of the whole stratification period and at the event scale. During the stratification period dissolved iron concentrations in the surface mixed layer could increase over the whole Mediterranean Sea by 1.8-5.3 nM in response to the accumulation of atmospheric iron from both anthropogenic and natural origins, confirming a strong impact of atmospheric inputs on the iron marine cycle in the Mediterranean Sea. Dissolved phosphate in surface waters was calculated to be significantly augmented by the atmospheric inputs during summer and we estimated that the atmospheric input of phosphate can sustain the new primary production during the stratification period at the scale of the whole open Mediterranean. At the event scale the response of the biota to a strong dust fall, which occurred during the Adios year in the Ligurian Sea, was registered by the water column biogeochemistry and chlorophyll content; this Saharan event did bring a considerable amount of dust and new nutrients, inducing a significant new production and a doubling of the chlorophyll concentration in the surface mixed layer. This event, accompanied by strong winds and heavy rains, also induced profound changes in the physical characteristics of the surface waters, triggering the beginning of the destratification of the surface waters that also induced an input of P from below. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Full-domain computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of random wave and structure interaction is considered impractical by many researchers. Simplified approaches are usually adopted to alleviate expensive CFD random wave simulation. In this paper, we present a rigorous methodology that solves the Navier–Stokes equations entirely without any need for matching. In our simulation scenario, a container ship cruising at a constant speed is allowed to heave and pitch in random waves. Both head-sea bow slamming at a speed of 6 knots and following-sea stern slamming at 0 and 5 knots are studied. Irregular waves are used to simulate a realistic seaway environment. A very effective procedure is developed to capture the desired waves at a specific part of the sailing vessel. A level-set function is employed to capture the violent free surface and to simulate the interaction of the random wave and the ship. This rigorous Navier–Stokes numerical approach is able to capture complex mechanisms and show results that are possible only with CFD simulations, thus providing useful information for ship designs.},

abstract = {A significant part of all structural damage to conventional ships is caused by complex free-surface events like slamming, breaking waves, and green water. During these events air can be entrapped by water. The focus of this article is on the resulting air pockets affecting the evolution of the hydrodynamic impact pressure that loads the ship's structure. ComFLOW is a computationally efficient method based on the Navier-Stokes equations with a Volume-of-Fluid approach for the free surface, designed to perform multiphase simulations of extreme free surface wave interaction with maritime structures. We have extended ComFLOW with a Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model for surface tension, thereby completing our method for representing gas-water interaction after free surface wave impacts. The implementation was verified with benchmark cases addressing all relevant aspects of the dynamics of entrapped air pockets. The implementation was validated by means of a dam-break experiment, a characteristic model for green water impact events. The method-having been verified and validated-was applied to a dam-break simulation for a different setting in which the impact on a wall leads to an entrapped air pocket. Surface tension was found not to have an influence on entrapped air pocket dynamics of air pockets with a radius larger than 0.08 [m]. For wave impacts it was found that the effect of compression waves in the air pocket dominates the dynamics and leads to pressure oscillations that are of the same order of magnitude as the pressure caused by the initial impact on the base of the wall.

abstract = {The scaled model testing of a FPSO with its mooring lines and risers for deepwater and ultra-deepwater installation sites is considered to be the most reliable methodology to study the complex hydrodynamic behaviour of the complete system, since it can represent the nearest real environmental conditions and the comprehensive hydrodynamic interactions of the waves, current and wind with the total floating production system. The best technical option, at the present time, is a combination of an appropriate scale model of the FPSO and a suitable level of truncation obtained using a hybrid passive truncated experimental methodology for the mooring lines and risers. This is in order to minimize the various uncertainties in model behaviour and to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of the complete floating system and thus to validate numerical design of prototype systems for installation in deepwater and ultra-deepwater locations. This paper investigates the global response of a specific FPSO to prevailing environmental conditions, based on a hybrid passive truncated experimental methodology for the mooring lines and risers in a specific deepwater location with a water depth of 1000m in the GOM. The main objective of the experiment is to examine the nonlinear effects of the FPSO vessel and its mooring lines and to provide reliable experimental data for subsequent extrapolation to a full scale prototype design. Several case studies were carried out. The FPSO global responses for Full load and Ballast Load conditions with static and dynamic load tension components of the truncated mooring lines were studied for both collinear and non-collinear extreme storm environmental conditions. The experiments revealed that the main horizontal plane motion response of the FPSO (surge) under non-collinear loading condition is almost two-times that of the collinear loading condition.},

abstract = {In design storm sea states, wave-in-deck forces need to be analysed for fixed and floating offshore platforms. Due to the complex physics of wave impact phenomena, numerical analyses should be complemented by model test data. With a large statistical variability, such experiments usually involve running many 3-h storm realisations. Efforts are being done to establish efficient procedures and still obtain improved statistical accuracy, by means of an initial simplified screening based on parameters derived from the incident wave record only. Here, we investigate the vertical rise velocity of the incident wave elevation at a fixed point in space, which indirectly measures both the local slope and the near-surface orbital velocity. A derived simple deck slamming model is also suggested, to support the check of the physical basis of the approach. Correlation against data from a GBS wave-in-deck model test is used for checking this model. The results show that, although there is a significant random scatter in the measured impact forces, especially in the local slamming forces but also in the global forces, there is a correlation to the rise velocity. Comparisons to the simple load model also show promising results when seen on background of the complex physics and random scatter of the impact problem.},

abstract = {This paper provides a time-domain simulation on green water of a Wigley hull sailing in regular head waves. To predict the strong non-linear phenomenon of green water, a numerical model is established by utilizing FINE/Marine, a multiphase-flow software based on free-surface capturing method. The problem of green water impacting on deck is systematically investigated by varying the wavelengths and wave amplitudes. Based on viscous flow theory, a solid-liquid-gas three-phase flow coupling model is developed for more realistic simulation by adopting the BRICS compressible discrete scheme as the free-surface capturing scheme which reduces numerical diffusion near the free surface. This model can well process problems of breaking waves and evolution of complicated free surface. By using this numerical model, impact loads on deck and hull, ship-motion characteristics and hydrodynamic characteristics during the green water process are investigated. The snapshots of the fluid field and ship location are also illustrated and analyzed, which coincide with actual physical phenomenon satisfactorily. This study is helpful for the design of ship principal dimensions and structure strength.},

abstract = {The reflection of wave energy from natural beaches is a quantity that is rarely measured. This paper addresses the question as to whether the reflected wave energy from a beach is an important component of energy flux from an engineering point of view. Wave run-up and wave setup are important nearshore processes in which wave reflection appears to play a major role and, consequently, the prediction of reflected wave energy from the offshore forcing irregular wave train energy at natural beaches is a first step in a better understanding of these processes. The present paper reports on wave reflection measurements at two natural beaches with different characteristics. The issue of wave reflection is addressed via separation of input and output signals using coincident pressure and velocity measurements. In the present limited analysis, reflected wave energy was not found to be significant. INTRODUCTION WAVE REFLECTION from beaches is a subject of major importance to understanding the nearshore zone and to improving coastal structure design. The level of energy flux dissipation that occurs on a beach is dependent on the magnitude of the wave reflection from the beach. Thus, in an indirect manner, wave reflection influences many coastal processes such as run-up which, in turn, determines coastal design criteria such as the height of a seawall or flood protection dune. Much information on reflection comes from limited laboratory and theoretical studies based on monochromatic water wave theory. Miche (1951) proposed a semi-empirical criterion for prediction of wave reflection from sloped structures for the case of monochromatic incident waves in which limited energy dissipation occurred. Miches' (1951) results have been shown to be a reasonable "rough" approximation for mono-chromatic waves incident on some structure slopes [Ursell et al. (1960); Battjes (1974); Guza and Bowen (1977)]. Moraes (1970) performed extensive small scale laboratory tests on monochromatic wave reflection from both smooth and rough slopes with the mildest slope being 1 on 10. Battjes (1974) later used the Moraes' (1970) data set to derive a semi-empirical expression for reflection coefficient based on Miches' (1951) work with added independent assumptions. Seelig and Ahrens (1981) further refined the Battjes (1974) reflection coefficient expression by empirical curve fitting. Reflection from natural (mild, rough, non-linear in profile) beaches under irregular wave action is considerably more complex and little is presently known concerning such processes. To date, measurements of wave reflection coefficients from beaches have been made primarily via measurements in the nearshore zone, typically using either a best fit of the standing wave amplitude pattern to produce a composite reflection coefficient [Suhayda (1974)], or using linear long wave theory to calculate the composite reflection coefficient [Takezawa et al. (1988)] or to calculate the frequency dependent},

abstract = {In this paper, a method for predicting the extreme value distribution of the vertical bending moment (VBM) in a ship under a given short-term sea state is presented. To predict the extreme value distribution of the VBM, the first-order reliability method (FORM), by which the most probable wave episodes (MPWEs) leading to given VBMs are identified, is introduced. The coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite-element analysis (FEA) are used to provide the high-fidelity numerical solutions for the wave-induced and whipping components of the VBM. Then, a Reduced-Order Model (ROM) which can yield the predictions equivalent to the coupled CFD–FEA results in a relatively short time is developed. The ROM is incorporated into FORM to identify the MPWEs, in lieu of the coupled CFD–FEA. The accuracy of the ROM is verified by comparing with the coupled CFD–FEA results under identified MPWEs, in terms of both the wave-induced and whipping VBM. Then, a series of tank tests using a scaled container ship is conducted. In the first series of the tests, the VBM measurements under the MPWEs identified from the FORM-based approach using the ROM are made, to validate the accuracy of the ROM. The extreme value distribution of the combined wave-induced and whipping VBM is also measured by performing the second series of the tests, in random waves. The validity of the FORM-based extreme value prediction using the ROM is investigated by comparing with the second series of the tests.},

abstract = {In on-board decision support systems, efficient procedures are needed for real-time estimation of the maximum ship responses to be expected within the next few hours, given online information on the sea state and user-defined ranges of possible headings and speeds. For linear responses, standard frequency domain methods can be applied. For non-linear responses, as exhibited by the roll motion, standard methods such as direct time domain simulations are not feasible due to the required computational time. However, the statistical distribution of non-linear ship responses can be estimated very accurately using the first-order reliability method (FORM), which is well known from structural reliability problems. To illustrate the proposed procedure, the roll motion was modelled by a simplified non-linear procedure taking into account non-linear hydrodynamic damping, time-varying restoring and wave excitation moments, and the heave acceleration. Resonance excitation, parametric roll, and forced roll were all included in the model, albeit with some simplifications. The result is the mean out-crossing rate of the roll angle together with the most probable wave scenarios (critical wave episodes), leading to user-specified specific maximum roll angles. The procedure is computationally very effective and can thus be applied to real-time determination of ship-specific combinations of heading and speed to be avoided in the actual sea state. {\textcopyright} 2007 JASNAOE.},

Developing closure models from experimental data is expensive. Robust and accurate closures laws can be obtained through surrogate modeling using high-resolution mesoscale simulations. However, development of surrogate models for drag from 3D high-fidelity simulations of shock interaction with clusters of particles can be computationally prohibitive. This paper explores various strategies to efficiently construct surrogate models for drag on particles in the shocked flow. The cost of generating training data is reduced by selecting optimal grid resolutions, particle arrangements in clusters, and size of particle clusters, i.e., by selecting suitable representative volumes (RVEs). Different surrogate modeling strategies such as multi-fidelity and parameter-by-parameter construction approaches are examined. The surrogate models obtained from the different methods are compared to determine the most cost-effective machine learning based surrogate modeling method in the context of shock-particle interactions.},

The user has requested enhancement of the downloaded file. ABSTRACT Pressures induced by sloshing phenomenon are widely studied through small scale model tests. This implies the need to satisfy scaling laws governed by dimensionless numbers. Froude number is the one governing the overall liquid flow within the tank. It means that changing the scale or the fluids would lead to analogous overall flows when Froude number is satisfied. Based on this, the experimental modelling consisting in moving a small scale model tank filled with water and air is commonly considered representative enough to derive sloshing pressures occurring in a full scale tank filled with LNG and its vapour. Nevertheless, impact pressures are strongly influenced by local phenomena, and hence other dimensionless numbers, such as the density ratio between the liquid and the gas, are likely to govern this local behaviour. Aware of possible consequences on sloshing assessment methodology, GTT decided to dedicate a specific R&D program on the density ratio influence, including theoretical, numerical and experimental studies. On the one hand, theoretical (Dias, Ghiadaglia, Le Coq, 2007) and numerical (Braeunig, Brosset, Dias, Ghidaglia, 2009) studies proved that the density ratio has a significant effect on the transfer of momentum between the liquid and gas during the impact: the impact velocity is slowed down, but the overall flow remains almost unchanged. On the other hand, sloshing vapour tests (water and its vapour) at small scale were performed in order to investigate the influence of density ratio on the statistical pressure distributions, the rise times of the impact pressures and the proportion of gas pocket events (impacts with gas entrapment that are likely to be governed by a scaling law other than Froude's). A pressure vessel, able to withstand both low and high pressures, allowed to study a large range of density ratios by using water and its vapour along the phase boundary. Complementary tests were performed with an ullage gas heavier (Sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6)) or lighter (Helium (He)) than air for comparison with the vapour tests of the corresponding ratios of density. This paper summarizes the accomplished work and the consequences of having fluids in the model tank satisfying the same density ratio as the one of LNG and its vapour within tanks of LNG carriers. It explains why GTT considers that satisfying the equality of the density ratios at both scales allows a better experimental modelling and why it is conservative from a design point-of-view. These conclusions led to a major improvement of GTT's reliability-based methodology: sloshing model tests are now performed with water and a mixture of SF 6 and N 2 .},

The main question of interest is: which sea states will lead to the worst panel performances in terms of reliability? As stiffened panel collapse is governed by combined lateral and in-plane loading effects (non-linear functions of the wave environment) this is not a simple problem and does not easily fit into the confines of traditional analyses. Interesting sea states for stiffened panel collapse are identified by a low-order design contour method which uses order statistics and extreme value theory. The resulting multimodal design contours pinpoint areas of interest and the panel performances are confirmed using a higher-order reliability analysis: the non-linear Design Loads Generator process. Such results have impact for creating and interpreting environmental and design contours, as well as assumptions about which operational profiles will lead to the worst system responses.},

abstract = {We combine experimental, theoretical and numerical efforts to investigate the turbulent wake far behind a surface ship at model scales. Experimental measurements using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) are performed for the wakes of three towed hulls with beam-to-draught ratios b/d = 1, 2, 6. Based on model speed and beam, the Reynolds and Froude numbers are O(103) and O(10-2) respectively. Distinct surface features associated with persistent surface-normal vorticity have been identified, which are characterized by large-scale meandering structures. Both lateral and longitudinal scales of the meandering are quantified, with the former found to increase as b/d decreases and the latter independent of b/d. Based on measurements at multiple horizontal and vertical planes, profiles of the mean flow and fluctuation intensity for each velocity component are obtained. To understand the turbulence transition mechanism, an Orr-Sommerfeld stability analysis (OS) is formulated for the wake flow with free-surface boundary conditions, and solved by using a fourth-order finite-difference scheme. Unstable modes antisymmetric to the wake centre-plane are identified. Consistent with the experimental results, the growth rates of unstable modes increase substantially as b/d decreases, while the dependence of meandering wavelengths on b/d is found to be weak. Finally, we perform direct numerical simulation (DNS) of Navier-Stokes equations for the wake flow. The growth rates of unstable modes agree well with the predictions by OS analysis. Compared with experiments, DNS accurately captures the surface-normal vorticity signatures, the meandering features, as well as statistics of turbulence intensity. We also obtain from DNS a detailed description of enstrophy, turbulence length scales, and vortex structures for the wake flow.},

abstract = {The structure of turbulence in a spilling breaker has been studied experimentally based on the transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy (the k-equation). We study turbulence transport in the evolving flow from the breaking point to the inner surf zone in the region below trough level and above the bottom boundary layer. The study shows that turbulence transport processes are similar in the outer and inner surf zones. It is found that diffusive transport plays the most important role in the distribution of turbulence, while advection is important mainly near the surface. It is also found that although turbulence production below trough level amounts to only a small portion of the wave energy loss, the production term is not small compared to the dissipation term and the major terms in the k-equation and thus it cannot be neglected. The mixing length is estimated based on the measured rates of vertical advance of the turbulent front, and comparisons of turbulence production and energy dissipation. The results are similar to those found in previous studies. It is shown that the length scale and velocity scale of the large eddies are subject to turbulence transport processes, therefore their distributions cannot be prescribed in an easy way. The relative values of the components of the Reynolds stress tensor are examined. The results of analysis supports the notion that surf-zone turbulence created by spilling and plunging breakers differ primarily in the method of energy transfer from organized wave-induced motion to turbulent motion, and the constraints imposed by the mean flow and the solid bottom on the large-scale turbulence.},

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic numerical approach to investigate green water loads on a fixed structure using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and the wet dam-break method to generate rapid flow-structure interactions. The experimental study of Hern{\'{a}}ndez-Fontes et al. (Patterns and vertical loads in water shipping in systematic wet dam-break experiments, Ocean Eng., 2020), investigated vertical green water loads. In this paper, it was extended to evaluate more green water scenarios, study horizontal loads and analyse the performance of three different plate-type deck edge protections in minimizing green water loads. The numerical results were validated. Then, the performance of the protection plates, arranged in different configurations (i.e., horizontal, sloped and vertical), in minimizing and delaying horizontal and vertical green water loads, was investigated. The numerical results allowed different green water load trends to be identified. For most cases, the sloped protection was better in reducing the maximum horizontal and vertical loads, by delaying the occurrence of horizontal loads. This approach can be used as an engineering tool to investigate water shipping loads numerically in a reasonable computational time. It can be extended to other applications that aim to reduce green water loads in a variety of structure configurations.},

abstract = {The present study investigated green water velocities and impact pressures caused by the impact of overtopping waves on a fixed deck structure in a large-scale, three-dimensional deep-water wave basin. Using the bubble image velocimetry technique, detailed two-dimensional surface flow structures on a horizontal plane, including the temporal and spatial distributions of the maximum horizontal velocities, were successfully obtained. Pressure measurements were also obtained along four different vertical positions at three different locations on the horizontal plane. Based on the mean velocity distributions on the deck surface, the most significant spatial variability of the propagating green water flow is the protruding wave front near the center of the deck during the early stages of the wave overtopping. The maximum front speed of 1.5C was first observed near the midpoint of the deck along the deck centerline with C being the wave phase speed. The flow velocities decreased to below 1C once the wave front passed the rear edge of the deck. Most of the measured pressures showed impulsive impacts characterized by a sudden rise of the pressure peak. The highest pressure was observed as 1.65$\rho$C<sup>2</sup> at a midpoint and a rear edge of the deck with $\rho$ being the water density. Correlations between wave kinetic energy and dynamic pressure were examined to determine the impact coefficients. The phase speed based impact coefficient was found to vary within a narrow range between 0.29 and 1.69 and a practical value of 1.5 may be used in applications. It appears that the impact pressures on the structures were strongly affected by the changing front shape of the broken wave and the impulsiveness of the impinging wave that contains a considerable amount of air entrainment.},

abstract = {Droplet deformation by air cushioning prior to impact is considered. A model is presented coupling the free-surface deformation of a droplet with the pressure field in the narrow air layer generated as a droplet approaches an impact. The model is based upon the density and viscosity in the air being small compared with those in the liquid. Additionally, the Reynolds number, defined using the droplet radius R and approach velocity Wl, is such that lubrication forces dominate in the air layer. In the absence of significant surface tension or compressibility effects, these assumptions lead to coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations describing the evolution of a droplet free surface approaching a solid wall through air, with or without topography. The problem is studied numerically with a boundary-element method in the inviscid droplet coupled with a finite-difference method in the lubricating air. In normal impacts, air cushioning will be shown to deflect the free surface upwards, delaying the moment of touchdown and trapping a bubble. The volume of the bubble is found to be ($\mu$g4/3R5/3P/l 4/3l4/3)V, where $\mu$g is the gas viscosity and Pl is the liquid density and the numerically computed pre-factor = 94.48. Bubble volumes predicted by this relationship are shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations. In oblique impact or impact with a moving surface with sufficient horizontal motion a bubble is not trapped beneath the approaching droplet. In this case, the region of touchdown is initially crescent shaped with air effects accelerating the moment of touchdown. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {In this paper, a procedure for computationally feasible multi-objective design optimization of aerodynamic surfaces is presented. Our approach exploits multi-fidelity aerodynamics models as well as a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). For the sake of cost reduction, the initial Pareto front is obtained by optimizing a fast kriging surrogate model using MOEA. The surrogate is constructed from sampled low-fidelity model which is pre-conditioned using high-fidelity model data and space mapping. The surrogate is then iteratively refined by enhancing it using high-fidelity model data points sampled along the Pareto set using co-kriging. The process is continued until the Pareto front representation produced by the surrogate aligns with the high-fidelity verification samples. The proposed method allows us to obtain—at a low computational cost—a set of aerodynamic geometries representing trade-offs between the figures of merit. Our approach is illustrated on the design of airfoil shapes in transonic flow at constant lift and obtaining the Pareto front for the drag and pitching moment coefficients.},

abstract = {We present a comparative study of the two-dimensional linear and nonlinear vertical and horizontal wave forces and overturning moment due to the unsteady flow of an inviscid, incompressible fluid over a fully submerged horizontal, fixed deck in shallow-water. The problem is approached on the basis of the level I Green-Naghdi (G-N) theory of shallow-water waves. The main objective of this paper is to present a comparison of the solitary and periodic wave loads calculated by use of the G-N equations, with those computed by the Euler equations and the existing laboratory measurements, and also with linear solutions of the problem for small-amplitude waves. The results show a remarkable similarity between the G-N and the Euler solutions and the laboratory measurements. In particular, the calculations predict that the thickness of the deck, if it is not "too thick," has no effect on the vertical forces and has only a slight influence on the two-dimensional horizontal positive force. The calculations also predict that viscosity of the fluid has a small effect on these loads. The results have applications to various physical problems such as wave forces on submerged coastal bridges and submerged breakwaters.},

A central air-disc is entrapped when the drop impacts the surface, and when the roughness is appropriately accounted for, the height and radial extent of the air-disc follow the scaling laws established for impacts onto smooth surfaces. The roughness also modifies the first contact of the drop around the central air-disc, producing a thick band of micro-bubbles. The initial bubbles within this band coalesce and grow in size. We also infer the presence of an air-film residing inside the microstructure, at radial distances outside the central air-disc.

Using these solutions, the numerical estimates for the reflection and the transmission coefficients, amplitudes of the hydrodynamic forces and energy dissipation coefficient are computed. The accuracy of the numerical results is established through an energy identity valid for permeable plates, and by comparing them with the published ones. A selection of new results is also presented for illustrative purposes. Importantly, in the present paper a mathematical method is developed to solve the problem of wave interaction with non-vertical (elliptic) plates with variable permeability. The derived numerical results indicate that the system of dual elliptic plates serves as a suitable model for a wave lens.},

abstract = {An analytical model has been developed that predicts the reflection of irregular waves normally incident upon a perforated-wall caisson breakwater. To examine the predictability of the developed model, laboratory experiments have been conducted for the reflection of irregular waves of various significant wave heights and periods impinging upon breakwaters having various wave chamber widths. For frequency-averaged reflection coefficients, though the overall agreement is fairly good between measurement and calculation, the model somewhat over-predicts the reflection coefficients at larger values, and under-predicts at smaller values. The model also underestimates the energy loss coefficients as wave reflection becomes larger. These differences occur because the model neglects the evanescent waves near the breakwater, which increase the energy loss at the perforated wall. The frequency-averaged reflection coefficient shows a minimum when the wave chamber width is approximately 0.2 times the significant wavelength, and it decreases with increasing wave steepness. Finally, it is shown that the reflection of irregular waves from a perforated-wall caisson breakwater depends on the wave frequency, so that the reflected wave spectrum shows a frequency dependent oscillatory behavior.

Two distinct scales of the pressure time histories, a slowly varying (in the range of the wave period) component in the order of stagnation pressure and a transient impact component with much higher pressures, have been identified and correlated to the incident wave kinematics. It is found that impact pressures can be approximately decomposed into a primary component associated with the overall wave evolution and a component influenced by the trapped air dynamics. These characteristics are comparable to those observed in shallow water-wave impact studies.

Here, we perform a perturbation analysis to quantitatively predict the initial deformations of the free surface of a liquid pool as it is approached by a solid sphere. We study the natural limits where the gas can be treated as a viscous fluid (Stokes flow) or as an inviscid fluid (potential flow). For both cases we derive the spatiotemporal evolution of the pool surface, and recover some of the recently proposed scaling laws for bubble entrapment. On inserting typical experimental values for the impact parameters, we find that the bubble volume is mainly determined by the effect of gas viscosity.},

Since released degree of freedom will decrease the efficiency, a Duck WEC with fixed pitching axis will be a better option. However, for fixed supported WECs, tide is a non-ignorable consideration. In this paper, a movable mass method is utilized in the whole tidal range to not only balance the Duck to appropriate beak angles, but also follow the variation of hydrodynamic coefficients to keep cancelling the reactance of the system impedance so that complex conjugate control can be realized to optimize the power capture performance of the Duck WEC in tide. Results show that the beak angle should be adjusted to as large a value as possible so that the response amplitude of the Duck at maximum relative capture width will be reasonable small, and the lowest weight of the movable mass is found when its designed position locates at the center of the Duck profile.},

abstract = {Simulations are often computationally expensive and the need for multiple realizations, as in uncertainty quantification or optimization, makes surrogate models an attractive option. For expensive high-fidelity models (HFMs), however, even performing the number of simulations needed for fitting a surrogate may be too expensive. Inexpensive but less accurate low-fidelity models (LFMs) are often also available. Multi-fidelity models (MFMs) combine HFMs and LFMs in order to achieve accuracy at a reasonable cost. With the increasing popularity of MFMs in mind, the aim of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art of MFM trends. For this purpose, publications in this field are classified based on application, surrogate selection if any, the difference between fidelities, the method used to combine these fidelities, the field of application and the year published. Available methods of combining fidelities are also reviewed, focusing our attention especially on multi-fidelity surrogate models in which fidelities are combined inside a surrogate model. Computation time savings are usually the reason for using MFMs, hence it is important to properly report the achieved savings. Unfortunately, we find that many papers do not present sufficient information to determine these savings. Therefore, the paper also includes guidelines for authors to present their MFM savings in a way that is useful to future MFM users. Based on papers that provided enough information, we find that time savings are highly problem dependent and that MFM methods we surveyed provided time savings up to 90%.

abstract = {Real coastal waves measured at 4 different locations in the world were analyzed in detail. Long travelled swell measured in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, wind swell from the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica, short period wind waves from the Ebro Delta in Mediterranean coast of Spain, and waves measured during the passing of Hurricane Wilma near Cancun, Mexico were analyzed. A total of 5795 wave records from the sites above were analyzed. A statistical stability analysis of the wave data was done. The measured wave height distribution was compared with the Raleigh distribution. The corresponding significant wave height and period distribution based on the zero down crossing method was obtained for all the records. The joint individual wave height-period distribution was obtained and the characteristic statistic wave heights and periods were obtained. The time variation of these parameters, including the skewness and kurtosis of the time series were obtained to determine the statistical stability of the data. A detailed spectral analysis using the Fourier transform was done on all the records. The whole record for each location was represented as time variant frequency energy spectrogram. The highest measured record's spectra for each site were examined in detail. The peakedness, band width, grouping, regularity spectral parameters, and the six principal moments of all the wave records were obtained. The spectra were then compared to the JONSWAP spectrum. Special attention was taken into the non-linear components present in the spectra. Temporal and energetic wave grouping parameters were analyzed using the run length theory. Low frequency modulation was examined against grouping observation. The capability of the variance spectra based on the Fourier transform to describe the measured wave grouping was analyzed and confirmed through the spectral grouping parameter Ka. The long waves present in the records were analyzed using a low pass filter. Spectral analysis was carried out on the filtered time series. The results between the different sites were compared and Longuet-Higgins set down equation under wave groups was calibrated and validated to predict the long wave spectral significant wave height, given the wave spectral significant height, the peak spectral period and the water depth outside the breaker zone. A spectral analysis using the Hilbert Huang method was done to the most energetic measured events of each record. A detail comparison was done between the result of the Fourier transform variance spectral analysis and the Hilbert Huang method. The limitations of the Fourier based spectra and the new Hilbert Huang transform spectra were examined in detail.},

Peregrine, "A model for breaking wave impact pressures," in Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Coastal Engineering (ASCE, Delft, 1990), Vol. 2, pp. 1473-1486]. Experimental data, based on a time-resolved particle image velocimetry technique and on a novel free-surface tracking method [M. Miozzi, "Particle image velocimetry using feature tracking and Delaunay tessellation," in Proceedings of the 12th International Symposium on Applications of Laser Techniques to Fluid Mechanics (2004)], are used to characterize the details of the flip-through dynamics while wave loads are computed by integrating the experimental pressure distributions. Three different flip-through modes are observed and studied in dependence on the amount and modes of air trapping. No air entrapment characterizes a "mode (a) flip-through," engulfment of a single, well-formed air bubble is typical of a "mode (b)" event, while the generation of a fine-scale air-water mixing occurs for a "mode (c)" event. Upward accelerations of the flip-through jet exceeding 1500g have been measured and the generation/collapse process of a small air cavity is described in conjunction with the available pressure time histories. Predictions of the vertical pressure distributions made with the pressure-impulse model of Cooker and Peregrine [M. J. Cooker and D. H.

abstract = {For the online prediction of nonlinear systems with characteristics of time-varying dynamics and uncertainty, a sequential grey prediction approach is proposed based on the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM). The grey processing of time series alleviates the unfavorable effects of uncertainty in measurement data; the extremely fast learning speed and high generalization accuracy of OS-ELM enable online application of the sequential grey prediction approach. Ship's roll motion at sea is a complex nonlinear process with time-varying dynamics. Its dynamics also involves uncertainty caused by wind, random waves and rudder actions. In this paper, the proposed OS-ELM-based grey prediction approach is implemented for online ship roll prediction. The simulation of prediction is based on measurement data obtained from sea trials of the scientific research and training ship Yu Kun. Simulation results of ship roll prediction demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed grey neural prediction approach in dealing with time-varying nonlinear system with uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Four different breaking wave impacts against a flat rigid wall are numerically simulated. The waves are generated and propagated along a wave canal by FSID, a non linear mono-fluid potential code (Scolan, 2010). For each wave, the last stage of the propagation and the corresponding impact are simulated by SPH-Flow software, after a restart from FSID calculation, with refined discretizations. SPH-Flow, developed by HydrOcean and Ecole Centrale Nantes (ECN), solves the compressible Euler equations for liquid and gas thanks to a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The four wave shapes before impact have been tuned in order to be representative of the shapes obtained during wave impact tests in flume tanks or during 2D sloshing model tests for low fills. A flip-through impact and three gas-pocket impacts with different sizes of the gas cavity have been selected. The different assumptions and models are presented for the four calculations. Results are shown in terms of pressure maps p(y, t), where y is the height of any point of the wall and t is the time. The time traces of the different components of the energy are also provided. The impact loads for the four waves are analyzed with regard to the wave characteristics and decomposed in Elementary Loading Processes (ELP) (Lafeber et al., 2012), showing common characteristics. This work is in line with a constant effort made by GTT in order to better understand the physics of sloshing impacts within LNG tanks on floating structures.},

abstract = {In this paper, a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model for FPSO operations over its field lifetime is presented as a design tool for probability based risk assessment on occurrence of extreme events such as green water, wave slamming etc. The model simulates the cascading effect of realistic combinations of FPSO loading conditions and its dependence on shuttle tanker operations. An FPSO engineering project normally includes a model test campaign to identify probability of occurrence and consequences of extreme events, such as green water or wave slam for a limited number of governing sea state with the FPSO in a vulnerable laden condition. At this stage, the risk assessment is limited to the fact that the FPSO experiences a governing sea state at a specified laden condition. The DES model presented in this paper addresses ways to remove the overtly conservatism in this risk assessment. The DES model aims to characterise the FPSO loading patterns between successive offloading cycles. The model includes delays in offloading cycle due to shuttle tanker arrival and readiness at FPSO, scheduled maintenance on the FPSO process systems, etc. The results from DES iterations help to quantify the occurrence probability for any specified loading pattern in the FPSO over its lifetime. Together with the metocean scatter diagram which defines number of occurrences for each sea state, a conditional probability of FPSO experiencing a loading condition at governing sea state is calculated. This conditional probability can be applied to unbiased risk assessment of extreme events occurring in a governing seastate when the FPSO is at a specified loading condition.},

Green water is a strong nonlinear phenomenon of ship-wave interaction, the variation of free surface of liquid is complicated, and there are still some difficulties to solve green water problems well with numerical simulation method. In this paper firstly the motion responses of the tumblehome hull was calculated based on 3D potential theory, and then the dam-break flow model was used to calculate green water height and pressure distribution. According to the result of numerical simulation, some typical working conditions are chosen for 3D CFD simulation using RANS method. The results of numerical simulation methods are compared with the experimental results measured in towing tank. The influence of different ship form parameters and wave parameters to the green water of tumblehome hull is analyzed, and some regularities of green water on tumblehome hull in regular waves are summarized.},

Air entrapment is forced via corrugations on a cylinder. Emphasis is given to the early stages of penetration effecting the total impact forces. Jet flows, pileups and free surface elevation profiles are characterised and compared with the ones obtained with a smooth cylinder. At low Froude numbers (Fr < 3), while the jet flow does not separate and climbs up on the solid surface of the smooth cylinder, the flow separation occurs and a cavity is formed during the water entry of the corrugated cylinder. The maximum impact force is a function of the wetted length which depends on the flow separation point. The numerical results showed good visual agreement with the experiments. The impacts under air cushioning and early flow separation effects produced 30% smaller impact pressures. ARTICLE HISTORY},

abstract = {During the early stages of drop-pool impacts, an air film is temporarily entrapped between the liquid bodies. At low impact velocities, this film can become highly stretched, allowing for contact-free penetration of the drop into the pool. The elongated film never ruptures for the lowest impact velocities, resulting in drop bouncing. For higher impact velocities, the elongated film ruptures to entrain hundreds of micro-bubbles in a process known as Mesler entrainment. At even higher impact velocities, an elongated film never forms as early contact entraps a shorter disk-type film which retracts to one or few central bubbles. In this work we use numerical simulations of water drop-pool impacts along with theoretical analyses to discover a capillary transition that prevents early contact. This transition allows the drop to penetrate further into the pool and provides a pathway for the formation of elongated films. Since Mesler entrainment is only possible if early contact is prevented, we use the occurrence of transition as a criterion to provide an upper boundary for the Mesler entrainment regime. We observe from low simulations that after transition, the drop spreads on the pool surface, during which the minimum film thickness increases and the film regularizes. Interestingly, we observe the formation of kinks between the centre of the film and the spreading fronts, and find asymptotic scaling laws governing the film thickness. Lastly, by examining the role of liquid viscosity, we shed light on transition dynamics for different liquids.},

For this, various multiple regression algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest Regressors (RFRs), Extra Trees Regressors (ETRs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and ensemble methods are employed. The effectiveness of the tested algorithms is investigated based on a number of key performance indicators, such as the mean and median average error and the coefficient of determination (R2). ETR and RFR models were found to perform best in both cases, whilst the existence of an ADLM system increased accuracy by 7% and reduced the required period for data collection by up to 90%. The derived models can accurately predict the FOC of vessels sailing under different load conditions, weather conditions, speed, sailing distance, and drafts.},

For engineers to design safe floating structures subjected to shipping water it is essential to gain an in-depth understanding of its depth and flow field, and the resulting impact forces. In this work, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is applied to understand the physics of shipping water washing over a stepped platform. We find that the most accurate solutions are obtained with the k−$\epsilon$ turbulence closure. The hydrodynamic load generated by the shipping water is found to strongly depends on the kinematic energy of the water hitting the step. It is shown that with smaller values of the freeboard a more dynamic flow ensues, with a stronger vortex and larger velocity gradient resulting in deeper shipping water and a larger impact force.},

The algorithm used in the model is a combination of spectral and boundary element methods: the boundary element method is used to translate physical quantities between the nonuniform ship surface and the regular grid of the spectral representation; the spectral method is used throughout the remainder of the fluid domain. All possible wave-wave interactions are included in the model (up to N-wave interactions for the truncation order N of the spectral expansions). This paper focuses on the mathematical theory and numerical method of the model and presents some numerical results for steady Kelvin waves in calm water. The nonlinear bow waves at high Froude numbers from the pseudo-spectral model are much closer to the experimental results than those from linear ship wave models. Our results demonstrate that the pseudo-spectral model is significantly faster than previous ship wave models: with the same resolution, the CPU time of the pseudo-spectral model is orders of magnitude less than those of previous models. Convergence speed of this model is ANLogN instead of BN2, where N is the number of unknown (note that the N for the traditional boundary element method may be significantly larger than the N for the pseudo-spectral method for the same quality solution).

Not much is known about the probable and possible horizontal distribution of shock pressures. In spite of work by others, more information is needed on the simultaneous vertical pressure distribution against a wall. No previous investigation involves a systematical, more detailed study of the pressure-time registration. The shock impulse and its distribution as well as the oscillation period and/or the duration of the shock pressure caused by the expected waves are important information for the design engineer.

Unseen data are then input into the model, where its output reflects a gauge of their normality, compared to the training dataset. This aids the dynamic detection of ship machinery incipient faults, contributing to the minimisation of ship downtime. A case study presenting applications of this modelling approach on ship machinery raw data is included, complemented by a sensitivity analysis.

This type of impacts occurs during sloshing at a high filling level and as breaking waves impact on sea walls. The air pressure inside this type of air pockets is nearly uniform in space and oscillates in time qualitatively like the free oscillations of a mass-spring system. New analytical natural-frequency formulas are derived for an entrapped air pocket on a vertical wall and for the entrapped air pocket at the upper corner of a sloshing tank. The formulas are verified through comparison with the boundary element method. A comparison between the new analytical formula for entrapped air pockets at the upper corner of a sloshing tank and experiments shows good agreement. The new analytical formula for the entrapped air pocket at a vertical wall is compared with experiments and an existing formula by Topliss et al. (1993). None of the analytical formulas could accurately estimate the natural frequency for this problem. Improved results were obtained by a boundary element method when the geometry of the air pocket and the free surface were fitted accurately. This work shows that the natural frequency is sensitive to both the assumed shape of the air pocket and the shape of the free surface outside the air pocket. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We develop a method for the evaluation of extreme event statistics associated with nonlinear dynamical systems, using a small number of samples. From an initial dataset of design points, we formulate a sequential strategy that provides the 'next-best' data point (set of parameters) that when evaluated results in improved estimates of the probability density function (pdf) for a scalar quantity of interest. The approach utilizes Gaussian process regression to perform Bayesian inference on the parameter-to-observation map describing the quantity of interest. We then approximate the desired pdf along with uncertainty bounds utilizing the posterior distribution of the inferred map. The 'next-best' design point is sequentially determined through an optimization procedure that selects the point in parameter space that maximally reduces uncertainty between the estimated bounds of the pdf prediction. Since the optimization process utilizes only information from the inferred map it has minimal computational cost. Moreover, the special form of the metric emphasizes the tails of the pdf. The method is practical for systems where the dimensionality of the parameter space is of moderate size, i.e. order O(10). We apply the method to estimate the extreme event statistics for a very high-dimensional system with millions of degrees of freedom: an offshore platform subjected to three-dimensional irregular waves. It is demonstrated that the developed approach can accurately determine the extreme event statistics using limited number of samples.},

abstract = {When an ocean wave breaks against a steep-fronted breakwater, sea wall or a similar marine structure, its impact on the structure can be very violent. This paper describes the theoretical studies that, together with field and laboratory investigations, have been carried out in order to gain a better understanding of the processes involved. The wave's approach towards a structure is modelled with classical irrotational flow to obtain the different types of impact profiles that may or may not lead to air entrapment. The subsequent impact is modelled with a novel compressible-flow model for a homogeneous mixture of incompressible liquid and ideal gas. This enables a numerical description of both trapped air pockets and the propagation of pressure shock waves through the aerated water. An exact Riemann solver is developed to permit a finite-volume solution to the flow model with smallest possible local error. The high pressures measured during wave impacts on a breakwater are reproduced and it is shown that trapped air can be compressed to a pressure of several atmospheres. Pressure shock waves, reflected off nearby surfaces such as the seabed, can lead to pressures comparable with those of the impact. Typical examples of pressure-time histories, force and impulse are presented and discussed in terms of their practical implications. The numerical model proposed is relevant for a variety of flows where air effects are important. Further applications, including extended studies of wave impacts, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The high-speed impact of a droplet on a bulk fluid at high Weber number (We) is not well understood but is relevant to the production of marine aerosol by raindrop impact on the sea surface. These splashes produce a subsurface cavity and a crown which closes into a bubble canopy, but a floating layer of immiscible oil, such as a crude oil slick, alters the splash dynamics. The effects of oil layer fluid properties and thickness, droplet size and impact speed are examined by high-speed visualization. Oil layer rupture and crown behaviour are classified by dimensional scaling. The subsurface cavity volume for impact on thick layers is shown to depend on the Reynolds number (Re), although canopy formation at high Re introduces a competing We effect since rapid canopy closure is found to retard cavity expansion. Time-resolved kinematic measurements show that thin crude oil slicks similarly alter crown closure and cavity growth. The size and spatial distributions of airborne droplets are examined using high-speed holographic microscopy. The droplets have a bimodal distribution with peaks at 50 and 225 $\mu$m and are clustered by size at different elevation angles. Small droplets (50 $\mu$m) are ejected primarily at shallow angles, indicating production by splashing within the first 100 $\mu$s and by breakup of microligaments. Larger droplets (225 $\mu$m) are found at steeper elevation angles, indicating later production by capillary instability acting on large ligaments protruding upward from the crown. Intermittent droplet release while the ligaments grow and sweep upward is thought to contribute to the size-dependent spatial ordering. Greater numbers of small droplets are produced at high elevation angles when a crude oil layer is present, indicating satellite droplet formation from ligament breakup. A crude oil layer also increases the target fluid Ohnesorge number, leading to creation of an intact ejecta sheet, which then ruptures to form aerosolized oil droplets.},

The cross-shore variations of the mean and standard deviation of the free surface elevation and horizontal fluid velocities above and inside a porous layer are predicted using the time-averaged continuity, momentum, and energy equations. The mean and standard deviation of the shoreline elevation measured by a runup wire are estimated from the predicted mean and standard deviation of the free surface elevation. The wave runup height above the mean water level, including wave setup, is assumed to be given by the Rayleigh distribution. The wave reflection coefficient is estimated from the wave energy flux remaining at the still water shoreline.

The interactions between breaking waves and the MarkIII corrugated membrane were described in Bogaert, Brosset and Kaminski (2010). The observations were based on the large scale impact tests of the Sloshel project performed in 2009. In this paper, these interactions are described again but based this time on the Sloshel full scale impact tests performed in 2010. In both test campaigns, unidirectional breaking waves were generated in flume tanks in order to break onto instrumented walls. Full scale tests were performed with a water height at rest of 4 m and the wall was covered by the real MarkIII membrane. Large scale tests were performed at scale 1:6, including the corrugated surface covering the wall, mimicking accurately the MarkIII membrane. In both cases pressure sensors were positioned in between the corrugations. Special sensors were designed to measure the forces on corrugations. The wave-corrugation interactions were captured by high speed cameras synchronized with the data acquisition system.},

The flow field of green water has been very difficult to obtain from either numerical computation or laboratory measurement. The dam-break flow model has been used in design to approximate the effect of green water due to the possible resemblance of the two flows, the simplicity of the dam-break flow, and the availability of analytical solutions of dam-break flow. In this study, the velocity of green water on a two-dimensional simplified model structure was measured using a newly developed technique called bubble image velocimetry (BIV). The profiles of horizontal green water velocity along the model deck are presented herein. Ritter's analytical solution for the dam-break flow problem is examined and compared with the measurements. Two alternative approaches for quantifying the initial water depth, a parameter required in the analytical dam-break flow model, are investigated. The solution with the initial water depth estimated using the front velocity of green water is found to be in good agreement with the green water measurements. In addition, the influence of the deck length on green water velocity is examined. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An analytical study is carried out on the wave generation of the system. It is shown that the paddle length could significantly affect the height of the generated waves, which could not happen in conventional wavemakers.

The one-way coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is employed to obtain numerical solutions of the WVBM. To predict the extreme value distribution based on the coupled CFD-FEA, the Reduced Order Method (ROM) is further introduced as a surrogate model for the CFD-FEA. By combining the ROM and FORM, the extreme value prediction equivalent to the coupled CFD-FEA can be estimated in a robust but inexpensive manner. The present ROM is composed of the transfer function (TF) of the WVBM and a simple correction for the nonlinearity. The accuracy of the ROM is validated by comparing with the coupled CFD-FEA results. A series of numerical demonstrations on the extreme value distribution of the WVBM using the ROM and FORM under moderate and severe sea conditions is given.},

Wave breaking itself, even in the case of plunging breakers, is found to be a secondary effect in this process, contributing by dissipating the overall wave energy without changing its relative spectral distribution significantly. The dominant physical mechanism is the amplification of the bound harmonics during the shoaling process, and their release in the deeper region, resulting in the decomposition of these finite amplitude waves. The observations suggest the feasibility of numerical modeling of the harmonics generation and release in breaking waves on the basis of a model for nonlinear conservative (non-dissipative) wave-wave interaction, to simulate the evolution of the spectral shape, in conjunction with a (semi-empirical) model for the dissipation of the total energy due to breaking. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Green Water Loading in the bow region of a Floating Production Storage and Offloading unit (FPSO) in head sea waves is studied by numerical means. A 2-D method satisfying the exact nonlinear free-surface conditions within potential-flow theory has been developed as a step towards a fully 3-D method. The flow is assumed 2-D in a plane containing the ship's centerplane. The method is partly validated by model tests. The importance of environmental conditions, 3-D flow effects, ship motions, and hull parameters are summarized. The wave steepness of the incident waves causes important nonlinear effects. The local flow at the bow is, in general, important to account for. It has become popular to use a dam-breaking model to study the propagation of water on the deck. However, the numerical studies show the importance of accounting for the coupled flow between the deck and outside the ship. When the water is propagating on the deck, a suitable distance from the bow can be found from where shallow-water equations can be used. Impact between green water on deck and a vertical deck-house side in the bow area is studied in details. A similarity solution for impact between a wedge-formed water front and a vertical rigid wall is used. Simplified solutions for an impacting fluid wedge with small and large interior angles are developed, both to support the numerical computations and to provide simpler formulas of practical use. It is demonstrated how the local design of the deck house can reduce the slamming loads. The importance of hydroelasticity during the impact is discussed by using realistic structural dimensions of a deck house. This indicates that hydroelasticity is insignificant. On the contrary, first results from an ongoing experimental investigation document blunt impacts against the deck during the initial stage of water shipping, which deserve a dedicated hydroelastic analysis.},

abstract = {The effects of entrained air in cushioning water impact on a wall are estimated by using a flow which has many similarities to the severe flip-through impacts that have been identified for water waves hitting a vertical wall. This is a filling flow which rapidly fills a confined region, such as a crack between blocks, or the space beneath a deck projecting from the coast (Peregrine & Kalliadasis 1996). The main properties of the filling flow are easily calculated, including the high-pressure peak which corresponds to the pressure peak of a flip-through. This work extends the study of filling flows to the case where the filling liquid is an air-water mixture, thus giving explicit results for the reduction of peak pressure due to the compressibility of entrained air. The behaviour of a bubbly liquid subject to substantial pressure changes is considered. Expressions are derived for an air-water mixture treated as a compressible fluid. The reduction in pressure from the incompressible case is found to be large even for relatively small air content, and depends more on the reduction in fluid volume than any other feature of the pressure-density relation. Results are presented in such a way that they may be used to estimate compressibility corrections to both the maximum and background pressures in a flip-through wave impact if corresponding incompressible pressure values are available.},

abstract = {The air bubble entrainment and self–aeration phenomena in free-surface water flows reveal a rich interplay of fundamental science and engineering, and the size distribution of the entrained bubbles enhances the air–water gas flux, improves the gas transfer, and influences the cavitation erosion protection in high–speed flows. In the present study, we investigate the bubble–formation mechanism of free–surface air entrainment and the related microscopic bubble scale in the laboratory. This paper provides a quantitative description of bubble entrainment. The entrapment deformation of the local free surface over a period follows a power–law scaling and entrains a bubble when the entrapped surface becomes enclosed in the unstable movement period. Both the size scale and shape character of the entrapped free surface determine the size and skewness of the distribution of the air bubble. The entrapment deformation process confirms that the instability behaviour of the local air–water interface results in the onset of bubble entrainment. Further research is necessary to elucidate the instability criterion dominated by the interface instability and promote a new understanding of multiphase flow generation and development.},

abstract = {This paper presents recent advances in knowledge on wave loads, based on experimental work carried out in the CIEM/LIM large flume at Barcelona within the framework of the VOWS (Violent Overtopping by Waves at Seawalls) project. Both quasi-static and impact wave forces from the new data set have been compared with predictions by empirical and analytical methods. The scatter in impact forces has been found to be large over the whole range of measurements, with no existing method giving especially good predictions. Based on general considerations, a simple and intuitive set of prediction formulae has been introduced for quasi-static and impact forces, and overturning moments, giving good agreement with the new measurements. New prediction formulae have been compared with previous measurements from physical model tests at small and large scale, giving satisfactory results over a relatively wide range of test conditions. The time variation of wave impacts is discussed, together with pressure distribution up the wall, which shows that within experimental limitations the measured pressures are within existing limits of previous study. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Catamaran vessels operating at high-speed can be exposed to deck diving and bow damage and one resolution of this problem is the wave-piercer design of INCAT Tasmania. Owing to the complexity of the unsteady non-linear flow in the bow area during large wave encounter model testing has been undertaken to identify the peak dynamic slam loads on the ship structure. This paper provides experimental benchmark information relating to the wave slam loads on wave-piercing catamaran ferries. Since the time frames of transient slam loadings and whipping vibration of the entire hull in its first bending mode are similar it is important that the test model replicates the whipping response and therefore needs to be a hydro-elastic model. A 2.5m hydro-elastic segmented catamaran model has been developed based on the 112m INCAT Tasmania wave-piercer catamaran to establish the peak wave slamming loads acting on the full-scale vessel. Towing tank tests were performed in regular seas at a maximum full-scale operating speed of 38 knots. The model was instrumented to measure the dynamic slam loads acting on the centre bow and vertical bending moments acting in the demihulls of the catamaran model as a function of wave frequency and wave height. Peak slam loads measured on the centre bow were found to approach the total weight of the model, this being a broadly similar result to the peak loads measured at full-scale. It was found that global dimensionless heave and pitch accelerations peaked in the same range of encounter frequency as did the peak slam load. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The experiments were conducted under regular wave conditions which were scaled down by a ratio of 1:125 from the BW Pioneer Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) operated in the Gulf of Mexico. PIV and BIV measurements were applied to obtain the water and bubbly flow in order to study the flow kinematics of multi-phase flow induced by green water. The mass flow rate and the kinetic energy, which were calculated from the water velocity profiles obtained by the PIV measurements were compared with and without the structure to investigate the quantitative flow kinematics of the water flow at the weather side of the structure. The characteristics of the bubbly flow in the water shipping phase on the deck were investigated based on the velocities of the bubbly flow obtained by the BIV measurements, and the velocities of the bubbly flow were compared with the solutions of dam break theory. Pressure measurements were taken along the structure to estimate the local loading of the green water phenomena and they provided the maximum peak pressure, rise time, impulsiveness of the pressures, and the peak frequencies of the pressure oscillation due to the air pocket generation on the wall of the structure during the green water.},

abstract = {Model tests of the Troll A platform with increased topside weight have been carried out at Marintek during the summer of 2007. During the model tests, first estimates for the q-probability response values were obtained using the 90% value of the 3-h response extreme value distribution for the sea state on the q-probability contour line for significant wave height, H s, and the peak period, T p, which gave largest response (i.e. the worst sea state). A comprehensive analysis program, where model test results and numerical calculations are used, has been carried out in order to establish a reliable set of design loads for the modified platform. This work revealed a need for verification of the applied percentile level for the design loads and was the motivation for this study.The verification process involves the following steps:. 1)Executing a full long-term analysis. This requires that a sufficient number of 3-h time domain simulations are carried out for a sufficient number of different sea states. It is important that the numerical calculations reflect the underlying physics with sufficient accuracy. 2) Screening analysis to determine the worst sea state in view of the problem under consideration along the 10 -2-probability contour 3)Establish the 3-h response extreme value distribution for this sea state. 4) The target percentile level is then obtained by the percentile giving the same result as the long-term analysis. The percentile levels are estimated for one wave direction and a set of response quantities, but the main focus has been put on the overturning moment and the base shear. A general observation is that the percentile levels vary somewhat for the response quantities. It is further found that the " correct" percentile level may depend on whether maxima or minima are considered. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {<p>Coastal defence works, such as breakwaters, are structures that aim to support the action of waves and dissipate their energy. Therefore, they provide conditions for stabilizing the coast, protecting ports, beaches and other coastal infrastructures and ecosystems. Semicircular breakwaters have been applied in different locations around the world due to their aesthetic advantages and high structural performance. Marine structures are subject to hydrodynamic actions normally estimated through physical models. However, these models are complex to implement, involving high costs and long experimental procedures. Thus, alternative methodologies for studying the hydrodynamic performance of these structures are of great use. This work presents the results of the application of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool to study the stability of a perforated semicircular breakwater, based on a rubble mound foundation. The model was validated against experimental results of the critical weight necessary to resist sliding, taking into account the effects of water depth and different characteristics of the waves. A comparison is made between the perforated and the non-perforated solution in terms of the breakwater's performance to dissipate wave energy. Dissipation conditions of this energy, in the exposed face, are also evaluated in detail, in order to assess the potential of this structure as a biological refuge for marine species. Both solutions show similar performance in terms of results obtained for the wave reflectivity coefficient. The turbulence dissipation on the exposed face of the perforated breakwater is limited to a region of restricted extension around it, which is advantageous in terms of the passage of species into the breakwater.</p>},

abstract = {With harshening ocean environments and the push to extend the service life of vessels and platforms, lifetime structural design performance is an increasingly important factor to differentiate between design options. But despite many advancements in structural modeling, reliability analysis may still be too time consuming and computationally expensive to be employed for local design choices. Reliability analysis for stiffened ship panels is additionally complicated as the collapse mechanism is due to combined stochastic lateral and in-plane loading effects [1]. This paper employs the non-linear Design Loads Generator (NL-DLG) process [2] to efficiently estimate the probability of stiffened ship panel collapse while retaining the wave profiles which lead to lifetime responses. This information allows a direct comparison between panel options and highlights critical panel parameters which are strongly related to design robustness. The resulting ensemble of short NL-DLG wave profiles lead to similar statistical characteristics of the panel designs as do brute-force Monte Carlo Simulations, but reduce the required simulation time by a factor of nearly 87,000 for the same number of simulations. These directed wave profiles offer naval architects the opportunity to efficiently examine rare complex structural responses by linking high-fidelity structural and hydrodynamic models. The potential of the NL-DLG process is that relevant information about complex marine structures, even those with limit surfaces excited by combined non-Gaussian loading, can be obtained efficiently and in earlier stages of the design process via low-order surrogate models.},

abstract = {Ships that transport liquefied natural gas (LNG), floating units that produce or re- gasify LNG, and ships that use LNG as a fuel, all need to be equipped with dedicated cargo containment systems (CCSs) to hold the LNG and minimize the heat transfer. The LNG is at a temperature just below its boiling point, i.e. -162◦C at atmospheric pressure. The CCS minimizes the heat transfer by an insulation in order to limit the evaporation of the LNG and protect the steel of the floating structure. Three quarters of the active LNG fleet was equipped with membrane types of CCSs at the end of 2017 (IGU, 2018). The membrane CCSs (NO- or Mark-line) are widely used because they use the hull space most efficiently. The membrane CCSs are however technically more challenging as they are more sensitive to sloshing impacts. The LNG will slosh inside the tanks when they are partially filled and exposed to motions. Surface waves are formed that propagate towards and consequently im- pact the tank walls. Methodologies to assess sloshing in relation to the strength of the membrane CCSs have been developed. The state-of-the-art sloshing assessment methodology that was introduced in 2009 (Gervaise et al., 2009), relies on sloshing model tests to derive the probability distribution of the corresponding sloshing im- pact loads. The sloshing model tests are however inherently biased. Scaling factors based on the feedback at sea for large scale LNG carriers for which several decades of experience exist, are used to account for these biases. Lund-Johansen et al. (2011) and Pasquier and Berthon (2012) showed based on a six-year measurement campaign on board of a 148,000 m3 LNG carrier and the corresponding sloshing model tests, that the long-term statistics as defined by the assessment methodology are conser- vative. However, the short-term statistics do not consistently represent reality. This inconsistency needs to be overcome to further increase the validity of the sloshing assessment methodology for new designs and operations.},

abstract = {In recent years, turbine designers have relied more and more on 3D-CFD to come up with new and innovative airfoil designs. While individual CFD simulations are quite affordable nowadays, especially when used in aero optimization, where often thousands of CFD runs are required, the overall cost is still significant. In comparison, 2D-CFD simulations (Low Fidelity, LoFi) on multiple radially stacked airfoil sections (quasi-3D) are much faster, but less accurate because secondary flow effects are neglected. However, if HiFi and LoFi results (e.g. aerodynamic efficiency) are reasonably well correlated, multi-fidelity surrogate models, which are constructed from a small number of HiFi and LoFi results, can offer a good compromise. Once the surrogate model is available, it allows to approximate HiFi results representing for example different geometry variations based on the corresponding LoFi results, thereby eliminating the need for further HiFi computations. Thus the multi-fidelity approach can be used to speed up airfoil optimization. In this paper the applicability of (gappy) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD, GPOD) for building a multi-fidelity surrogate model is presented and compared to the widely-used kriging based surrogate models from a industrial point of view. As the name suggests, GPOD is based on the decomposition of the HiFi and LoFi computational domain into orthogonal basis functions. In contrast, kriging based surrogate models are built based on the differences in the output values (e.g. efficiency) from the HiFi and LoFi simulations. Both methods are compared in terms of accuracy of the predicted HiFi output values. In addition, the dependency between the accuracy of prediction and the number of HiFi simulations required for creating the surrogate model is given. The ideal surrogate method would provide a high level of accuracy while requiring only few HiFi evaluations. The surrogate models are evaluated for different geometry variations that are not included in the set used for building the surrogate models. The analysis is carried out for a number of turbine airfoils subject to different flow regimes, namely a gas turbine second and fourth stage vane and blade. It is found, that for the examined cases, the GPOD method gives better predictions while requiring fewer HiFi simulations for creating the surrogate model.},

In order to investigate air compressibility effects in different modes of breaking wave impact, a two-phase compressible flow model is proposed. A high-order finite difference method, Constrained Interpolation Profile (CIP) method is employed to discretize the Navier-Stokes equations, and the interface is captured by Tangent of Hyperbola for Interface Capturing (THINC) scheme. The present compressible model is validated against several tests: 1-D gravity-induced liquid piston motion, idealized free drop of water patch impact and dam-break experiments. Special attention of this study is paid to breaking wave impacts on a vertical wall in a liquid sloshing tank. For air entrapped impact, the results of CIP-based compressible model are in good agreement with experimental data. It is shown that the air compressibility leads to high-frequency oscillation of the impact pressure, which cannot be reproduced by the incompressible model. It is found that the oscillation of the impact pressure is synchronized with the compression and expansion of the entrapped air pocket, and the oscillation frequency is related to the size of air pocket. For air-water mixing impact, the oscillation of the pressure may be more intense.},

abstract = {The nowadays frequent use of FPSOs for offshore oil pro- duction in areas prone to green water events has increased the in- dustrys focus on wave-induced impact loads as an important de- sign parameter. This is a complex hydrodynamic problem where simplified engineering methods are often used in connection with model testing. Various efforts have been presented during the re- cent 10-15 years to establish reasonably good industry design tools, while the use of fully nonlinear methods and CFD is still in its development. The main focus of this paper is to investigate the potential of a simplified coupled method between a potential theory based Green Water engineer tool (Kinema3) and the com- mercial CFD tool Star-CCM+ based on its Navier-Stokes Solver (NS) and the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. Results from a case study application on a large FPSO are validated against model test data. The case study contains analyses of the FPSO in long crested regular seas, both in fixed and in moored con- ditions. Three different heading directions are included. The approach for modeling green water events uses a Finite-Volume- VOF method with a complex velocity inlet boundary condition. Thus the Kinema3 engineering tool is used to generate simplified spatio-temporal inlet conditions from the relative wave elevation and wave kinematics at the bulwark, based on linear potential theory combined with nonlinear random wave kinematics. The VOF method is then used to model the detailed flow on deck, including impact forces on deck structures. Kinema3 can also generate simplified estimates for the peak water height, veloc- ity as well as impact force values assuming an extended dam- break approach together with a simplified, local 2D deck lay- out, and comparisons to the CFD results show an overall fairly good agreement although flow details on deck can of course not be expected to be modeled that well. Comparisons of the above results to model test data show good agreement both for the rela- Tive wave height, water height and impact force level, in regular and irregular waves. Detailed time histories, including force rise time, from the coupled Kinema3 - Star-CCM+ CFD simulation analysis are quite similar to the measured ones. The CPU time consumption for the coupled simulation is moderate compared to a full CFD simulation of the FPSO in waves. Hence the achieved calculation time and the simplicity of the simulation setup of the numerical simulation makes this method an interesting candidate for industrial use. This work is a part of the research project "Green Water and Wave Impact on FPSO" carried out for and in cooperation with PETROBRAS.},

Study further about it can help for local people living in the coastal area and for academic learning. The tidal wave was replicated using a flume tank. The sand used is fine-grained that taken from Sawarna beach. To obtain the quantitative Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used. The DEM data were taken using a laser distance meter after the experiment. Reynold's Rule was used for scaling down the variable that happens in nature to the experiment scale. There are 3 significant changes as a result of this experiment. First, the sediment was sorted according to the grain size of the sediment. Second, the slope of the coast has changed which is measured by DEM. Third, the sediment structure was created which has a similarity with the one created by nature. So, the result was a proof that Reynold's scaling down methods can be used to scale down a sedimentary process that happens in nature. This research explains what exactly happens in the formation of a sedimentary structure.},

abstract = {In the last years, predictive maintenance has gained a central position in condition-based maintenance tasks planning. Machine learning approaches have been very successful in simplifying the construction of prognostic models for health assessment based on available historical labeled data issued from similar systems or specific physical models. However, if the collected samples suffer from lack of labels (small labeled dataset or not enough samples), the process of generalization of the learning model on the dataset as well as on the newly arrived samples (application) can be very difficult. In an attempt to overcome such drawbacks, a new deep supervised learning approach is introduced in this paper. The proposed approach aims at extracting and learning important patterns even from a small amount of data in order to produce more general health estimator. The algorithm is trained online based on local receptive field theories of extreme learning machines using data issued from a propulsion system simulator. Compared to extreme learning machine variants, the new algorithm shows a higher level of accuracy in terms of approximation and generalization under several training paradigms.},

abstract = {While the classical problem of a flat plate impact on a water surface at zero dead-rise angle has been studied for a long time both theoretically and experimentally, it still presents a number of challenges and unsolved questions. Hitherto, the details of the flow field - especially at early times and close to the plate edge, where the classical inviscid theory predicts a singularity in the velocity field and thus in the free surface deflection, so-called ejecta - have not been studied experimentally, which led to mutually contradicting suppositions in the literature. On one hand, it motivated Yakimov's self-similar scaling near the plate edge. On the other hand, a removal of the singularity was previously suggested with the help of the Kutta-Joukowsky condition at the plate edge, i.e. enforcing the free surface to depart tangentially to the plate. In the present experimental study we were able to overcome challenges with optical access and investigate, for moderate Reynolds ( <![CDATA[$0.5<Re) and Weber ( <![CDATA[$1<We) numbers, both the flow fields and the free surface dynamics at the early stage of the water impact, when the penetration depth is small compared to the plate size, thus allowing us to compare to the classical water impact theory valid in the short time limit. This, in particular, enabled us to uncover the effects of viscosity and surface tension on the velocity field and ejecta evolution usually neglected in theoretical studies. While we were able to confirm the far-field inviscid and the near-edge Stokes theoretical scalings of the free surface profiles, Yakimov's scaling of the velocity field proved to be inapplicable and the Kutta-Joukowsky condition not satisfied universally in the studied range of Reynolds and Weber numbers. Since the local near-edge phenomena cannot be considered independently of the complete water impact event, the experiments were also set up to study the entirety of the water impact phenomena under realistic conditions - presence of air phase and finite depth of penetration. This allowed us to obtain insights also into other key aspects of the water impact phenomena such as air entrapment and pocketing at the later stage when the impactor bottoms out. In our experiments the volume of trapped air proved not to decrease necessarily with the impact speed, an effect that has not been reported before. The observed fast initial retraction of the trapped air film along the plate bottom turned out to be a consequence of a negative pressure impulse generated upon the abrupt deceleration of the plate. This abrupt deceleration is also the cause of the subsequent air pocketing. Quantitative measurements are complemented with basic scaling models explaining the nature of both retraction of the trapped air and air pocket formation.},

abstract = {In many scientific and engineering applications, we are tasked with the optimisation of an expensive to evaluate black box function f. Traditional methods for this problem assume just the availability of this single function. However, in many cases, cheap approximations to f may be obtainable. For example, the expensive real world behaviour of a robot can be approximated by a cheap computer simulation. We can use these approximations to eliminate low function value regions cheaply and use the expensive evaluations of f in a small but promising region and speedily identify the optimum. We formalise this task as a multi-fidelity bandit problem where the target function and its approximations are sampled from a Gaussian process. We develop MF-GP-UCB, a novel method based on upper confidence bound techniques. In our theoretical analysis we demonstrate that it exhibits precisely the above behaviour, and achieves better regret than strategies which ignore multi-fidelity information. MF-GP-UCB outperforms such naive strategies and other multi-fidelity methods on several synthetic and real experiments.},

abstract = {Although solitary wave generation using a piston-type wavemaker has been common, the method cannot be applied to all wave tanks because many of them have been or will be equipped with plunger-type wavemakers. How to use a plunger to generate solitary waves as good as those generated by a piston is an unsolved but practically significant problem. Herein, a theoretical method is proposed. New formulae for the precise descent of an arbitrary-geometry plunger are derived and constraints on the produced wave height are given. Taking wedge-shaped, box-shaped, and cylinder-shaped plungers as examples, the generic wave-making theory and constraints are then specified. On their bases a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model is applied to simulate the solitary wave generation, and its reliability is validated in advance by reproducing available experiments. The SPH-simulated wave profiles, velocity fields, and pressure fields are examined by comparing SPH results with analytical solutions. In addition, plunger-type and piston-type as well as Rayleigh-based and Boussinesq-based solitary wave generation are compared. The results show that the solitary wave generated by a plunger-type wavemaker can be as accurate as the one generated by a piston-type wavemaker, provided that the plunger does not have a sharp corner or an incompatible surface with the wave profile. It is therefore anticipated that the proposed theory will extend the functionalities of existing plunger-type wavemakers and benefit plunger design in the future.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The present paper describes recent efforts within the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) to improve experimental and numerical wave modelling and especially their combination. The ultimate objective is to be able to reproduce any wave condition from a basin or from sea in numerical tools and vice versa, including a sound treatment of basin effects, numerical effects and statistical variability. The aspects that are of importance in both types of wave modelling are first introduced, after which a number of examples of recent projects is discussed. It can be concluded that important steps were made towards linking experimental and numerical wave modelling, but there are some challenges common to all wave reproductions. Some future planned studies focussing on how to deal with them are discussed as well.},

abstract = {The effects of scale and aeration on violent breaking wave impacts with trapped and entrained air are investigated both analytically and numerically. By dimensional analysis we show that the impact pressures for Froude scaled conditions prior to the impact depend on the scale and aeration level. The Bagnold-Mitsuyasu scaling law for the compression of an air pocket by a piston of incompressible water is rederived and generalised to 3D air pockets of arbitrary shape. Numerical results for wall pressure, force and impulse are then presented for a flip-through impact, a low-aeration impact and a high-aeration impact, for nine scales and five levels of initial aeration. Two of these impact types trap a pocket of air at the wall. Among the findings of the paper is that for fixed initial aeration, impact pressures from the flip-through impact broadly follow Froude scaling. This is also the case for the two impact types with trapped air pockets for impact pressures below 318 kPa, while impact pressures above this value broadly follow the Bagnold-Mitsuyasu scaling law with full-scale pressures greater than those predicted by the Froude law. For all impact types, the effect of aeration is found to reduce the maximum impact pressure, maximum force and impulse. Good agreement with the asymptotic model of Peregrine & Thais (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 325, 1996, pp. 377-397) is found for the flip-through impact pressure and a fair agreement is found for the low- and high-aeration impacts. Based on the numerical results, a modified scaling curve that combines Froude scaling and the Bagnold-Mitsuyasu law is suggested. The practical implications of the findings are discussed and attention is drawn to the limitations of physical model tests.},

The Compression Model Law applies approximately to the maximum pressure of a compression shock. Froude's law is valid for a normal hammer shock, but insome cases a composite effect, also involving compressibility, may occur.

The commercial CFD code ANSYS FLUENT{\textregistered} was customized to have boundary conditions to represent specific wave intervals from irregular sea state realizations and vessel movements prescribed based on experiments. By using a VOF-multiphase and SST-turbulent setup, the accuracy of 2D and 3D simulations are evaluated by comparison with experimental data in terms of free surface evolution and loads, with good agreement in most cases. Some deviations on the loads were observed, but they are coherent with the complex local flow conditions of typical impact flows due to effects such as wave breaking and air entrapment. The methodology presented in this paper gives access to high spatial resolution free surface position, water velocities and load distribution, aspects usually not available from experiments, which leads to new possibilities in the investigation of shadowing effects and dynamic loads during green water and wave impact extreme events.},

First, water wave theory is described beginning with the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. A variety of wave theories are discussed, beginning with linearized wave theory, and continuing with Stokes, cnoidal and solitary wave theory. The regions of wave applicability for different theories are shown, summarizing the discussion of water wave theory. Following the introduction of water wave theory, ocean physics is introduced. This section includes ocean wave generation, random waves, spectral representation and commonly used wave spectra, including the Pierson-Moskowitz and JONSWAP spectra. Next, wave-body interaction is presented, first looking at static and then dynamic loads. The dynamic load discussion covers waves, added mass and impulse loads. The section on wave-body interaction concludes with a review of recent literature on wave-body interactions, with emphasis on offshore wind energy. Additionally, a sample of existing engineering tools for modeling hydrodynamics on offshore wind turbines is presented. Finally, finite volume methods are presented to lay the groundwork for reviewing recent computational fluid dynamics research relating to the wave-body interaction problem. The review culminates in a review of recent CFD research.},

abstract = {Water shipping on the deck of structures is a problem in marine environments. Different types of shipping water events can be expected, and systematic experiments are required to better understand their behavior. In this work, systematic experiments were carried out to analyse some patterns of shipping water events and the related vertical loads on the deck of a rectangular fixed structure, using the wet dam-break method to generate the incident waves. The influence of bores generated with different wet dam-break ratios on the resultant water shipping patterns and the trends of vertical loads on the structure was investigated. Conventional wave probes, a force balance and a high-speed camera were synchronized in a controlled environment for the investigation. The results allowed a detailed visualization of different types of shipping water events, mainly differentiated by the formation of different sized cavities at the bow of the structure. Quasi-static vertical loads over the deck generated by the events were presented, including forward and backflow loading. This approach can be useful when performing simplified analyses to investigate the details of shipping water behavior and for acquiring detailed data for model validations.},

abstract = {<p>The paper introduces a simplified coupled computational fluid dynamics–boundary element method–finite element method (CFD–BEM–FEM)-based approach to study the effect green water induced loading on global structural responses such as bending moment and shear force. The proposed numerical scheme is based on a coupled three-step model. Initially, rigid modes of structural motions are calculated adopting a three-dimensional (3D) time domain panel method without incorporating the green water loading. The time histories of the green water impact on the deck are computed using a finite volume-based CFD tool with these precalculated rigid body motions. Finally, the problem of fluid–structure interaction is solved by considering the green water force as an external input. The direct integration scheme (i.e., Newmark–Beta method in the time domain) is employed to solve this structural problem modeled with one-dimensional FEM. To check the robustness and efficacy of the proposed model and to evaluate green water effect on the structure and vice versa, a large container vessel with and without forward speed is investigated. The impact is studied with respect to motion, shear force, and bending moment. The results confirm that the impact of green water and structural flexibility is significant. Therefore, these effects must be considered while designing a container ship. Also, from the results, it appears that the present three-step model is an effective, efficient, and useful practical tool to predict such effects.</p>},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of ship hydroelasticity, which is an important technical issue in the design of ultra-large vessels. For the analysis of fluid-structure interaction problems, a partitioned method is applied. The fluid domain surrounding a flexible body is solved using a B-spline Rankine panel method, and the structural domain is handled with a three-dimensional finite element method. The two distinct methods are fully coupled in the time domain by using an implicit iterative scheme. The numerical results of natural frequency and the motion responses of simple and segmented barges are computed to validate the present method through comparisons with experimental and numerical results. This study extends to the application to two real ships, 6500 TEU and 10,000 TEU containerships, for more validation and also observation on the practicality of the present method. Based on this study, it is found that the present method provides reliable solutions to linear ship hydroelasticity problems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A large number of containers is lost every year from ships along shipping routes. Even though the economic losses are in most cases covered by insurance, the containers drifting in sea may compromise the safety of navigation. Moreover, there can be serious consequences for the environment, in terms of pollution. All the reported losses were caused by extremely violent motions of containerships, due to adverse weather conditions. This pointed out the need of further researches on safer container shipping, through heavy sea states. The accurate determination of design accelerations and loads on container stacks are of prime importance for safety. This paper proposes a realistic numerical modeling approach of the critical ship motions, including the pertinent nonlinearities. A method to evaluate a map of the dynamic loads along the container arrangement is presented. This calculation is based on a fine description of the acceleration distribution on the ship. Area exposed to higher accelerations will be highlighted. The method can be used to guide the design of lashing systems for containerships to sustain the actual accelerations and forces. Sample calculation of the forces acting at the container locks is provided for a conventional and a non-conventional container arrangement on board.},

abstract = {This study examines the hydrodynamic performance of a new perforated-wall breakwater. The breakwater consists of a perforated front wall, a solid back wall and a submerged horizontal porous plate installed between them. The horizontal porous plate enhances the stability and wave-absorbing capacity of the structure. An analytical solution based on linear potential theory is developed for the interaction of water waves with the new proposed breakwater. According to the division of the structure, the whole fluid domain is divided into three sub-domains, and the velocity potential in each domain is obtained using the matched eigenfunction method. Then the reflection coefficient and the wave forces and moments on the perforated front wall and the submerged horizontal porous plate are calculated. The numerical results obtained for limiting cases are exactly the same as previous predictions for a perforated-wall breakwater with a submerged horizontal solid plate [Yip, T.L., Chwang, A.T., 2000. Perforated wall breakwater with internal horiontal plate. Journal of Engineering Mechanics ASCE 126 (5), 533-538] and a vertical wall with a submerged horizontal porous plate [Wu, J.H., Wan, Z.P., Fang, Y., 1998. Wave reflection by a vertical wall with a horizontal submerged porous plate. Ocean Engineering 25 (9), 767-779]. Numerical results show that with suitable geometric porosity of the front wall and horizontal plate, the reflection coefficient will be always rather small if the relative wave absorbing chamber width (distance between the front and back walls versus incident wavelength) exceeds a certain small value. In addition, the wave force and moment on the horizontal plate decrease significantly with the increase of the plate porosity.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments were conducted to improve our understanding of the physics and characteristics of impact pressures due to collisions of breaking waves against a vertical wall. Measurements of impact wave pressures were performed simultaneously with observation of high-speed video pictures of the violent wave motion at the collision. The physics and characteristics of the impact pressure significantly depend on the colliding conditions of breaking waves. These were studied for the following colliding conditions: flip-through, collision of the vertical wave front, and plunging wave collision. When a small amount of air is entrapped between the breaking wave and the wall at the collision, the impact pressure increases considerably. The highest pressure, of very short duration, is observed when a vertical wave front strikes the wall while trapping a small amount of air in the form of either bubbles or a thin lens-shaped pocket. The impulsive pressure, occurring in the vicinity of the still water level, is transmitted downwards through the water body with the sound velocity. The larger the amount of the entrapped air at impact of the plunging breakers, the lower the magnitude and the longer the rise or compression time of the impact pressures. When plunging and curling of the breaking wave develop well, a thick air pocket is trapped, and damped pressure oscillations, due to the air pocket pulsation, appear immediately after the peak of the impact pressure. The oscillation frequencies are lower the greater the amount of entrapped air, and are almost equal to the resonant frequency of pulsating air pockets. The damping mechanisms, however, still remain unknown. Agreements between the measured and predicted oscillation frequencies suggest that adiabatic processes of the air pocket play an essential role in the physics of high impact pressure. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Two breaking wave conditions were tested: one with waves impinging on the vertical wall of the model at the still water level and the other with waves impinging on the horizontal deck surface. Pressure measurements were taken at locations in two vertical planes on the deck surface with one at centerline of deck and the other between the centerline and an edge. Impact pressure was found to be quite different between the two wave conditions even though the incoming waves are essentially identical. Two types of pressure variations were observed - impulsive type and non-impulsive type. Much higher pressure was observed for the deck impingement wave condition, even though the flow velocities were quite close. Void fraction was also measured at selected points. Impact pressure was correlated with the mean kinetic energy calculated based on the measured mean velocities and void fraction. Impact coefficient, defined as the ratio between the maximum pressure at a given point and the corresponding mean kinetic energy, was obtained. For the wall impingement wave condition, the relationship between impact pressure and mean kinetic energy is linear with the impact coefficient close to 1.3. For the deck impingement wave condition, the above relationship does not show good correlation; the impact coefficient was between 0.6 and 7. The impact coefficient was found to be a function of the rate of pressure rise. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Both laboratory and field tests that are described provide new information on the characteristics of wave impacts. Laboratory drop tests conducted using seawater and freshwater demonstrate that maximum impact pressures and rise times are influenced by both the level of aeration and the violence of the impact. A relationship is derived which enables the reduction in impact pressure caused by aeration to be estimated. This relationship is shown to provide a better means of predicting impact pressures in laboratory seawater wave tests from freshwater tests than either the Froude or Cauchy laws. Measurements are presented which show that, due to the different properties of seawater and freshwater, aeration levels are higher in seawater breakers than in freshwater breakers, even at a 1:25 model scale. The ways in which this affects the temporal variation in pressure and the scale relationships are discussed in some detail. Aeration and pressure measurements are also presented for full-scale wave impacts on a breakwater exposed to Atlantic waves. Attention is drawn to the likely role of expelled air and data included which indicate that the equivalent of up to 55% of entrained air does not necessarily prevent the occurrence of high impact pressures with short rise times. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In a container terminal, export containers are usually classified into one of a few weight groups and those belonging to the same group are stored together on a same stack. The reason for this stacking by weight groups is that it becomes easy to have heavier containers be loaded onto a ship before lighter ones, which is important for the balancing of the ship. However, since the weight information available at the time of container arrival is only an estimate, containers belonging to different weight groups are often stored together on a same stack. This becomes the cause of extra moves, or re-handlings, of containers at the time of loading to fetch out the heavier containers placed under the lighter ones. In this paper, we propose a method based on a simulated annealing search to derive a good stacking strategy for containers with uncertain weight information. Simulation experiments have shown that our strategies more effectively reduce the number of re-handlings than the traditional same-weight-group-stacking strategy. Also, additional experiments have shown that further improvement can be obtained if we increase the accuracy of the weight classification by applying machine learning. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.},

abstract = {The present paper describes an investigation on parametric resonance in head seas in which a new third-order coupled mathematical model is considered. The restored modes of heave, roll and pitch are contemplated. The discussion is illustrated for the case of a transom stern fishing vessel at different speeds. It is pointed out that numerical simulations employing the new model are successfully compared to experimental results previously obtained for the vessel. Considering that analyticity is an important tool when handling complex stability issues, some theoretical dynamic characteristics of the equations are discussed. By means of the analysis of the coupled linear variational equation derived from an extended third-order model, the appearance of super-harmonics and increased rigidity proportional to wave amplitude squared due to third-order terms is demonstrated. In the present paper, an important tool is explored, that is the analysis of the limits of stability obtained from the new model. Limits of stability are a well-known and practical way of looking into the problem of parametric resonance. New limits of stability are derived and compared to the more conventional Strut diagram. Dynamic characteristics associated with the new limits of stability are discussed. The influence of different parameters is investigated, including vessel speed, damping and tuning. Consistent and revealing results are obtained through the analysis of the new limits of stability for different speeds and damping. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The shipping of water on the deck of a vessel in head-sea conditions and zero-forward speed is investigated by experimental and numerical means. Through the experimental observations the main stages of the fluid-dynamic phenomenon are identified. For the considered conditions, water shipping initiates with water front overturning onto the deck, entrapping air, and then flowing along the initially dry deck up to impacting against vertical superstructures. Numerically, the water-on-deck phenomena are studied by considering a simplified two-dimensional flow problem. The theoretical model relies on the assumption of inviscid fluid in irrotational motion. Through comparison against experimental data, it is shown that the potential-flow model suffices to give a robust and efficient estimate of green-water loads until large breaking phenomena, usually following impact events, are observed. A boundary element method with piecewise-linear shape functions for geometry and boundary data is used for the numerical solution. The fluid-structure interaction is studied by coupling the nonlinear potential flow model with a linear Euler beam to represent a portion of the deck house under the action of the shipped water. The loading conditions related to violent fluid impacts and air-cushion effects are discussed. Upon considering realistic parameters, the occurrence of critical conditions for structural safety is discussed. The role of hydroelasticity is addressed in the case of fluid impacting against a vertical wall. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Breaking waves result in very different populations of bubbles in fresh water and seawater. The differences in sizes and numbers of bubbles in the two media cause significant differences in many natural processes including gas transfer and generation of aerosols as well as affect sound and light propagation and ambient sound production. Observed differences in bubble populations in seawater and fresh water have in the past been attributed to coalescence inhibition in seawater, but bubble-shattering studies described here suggest that other factors may be important. When air bubbles are expanded through an orifice at constant pressure drop, they can be made to shatter into clouds of smaller bubbles. We report here measurements showing that the number and size distribution of resulting populations depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the water samples. In particular, bubbles were found to break up into 4-5 times more small bubbles in seawater than in fresh water. The number of bubbles produced in shattering was found to be a function of salt concentration but was especially sensitive to the types of ions present. In addition, medium from the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum was found to further double production numbers, and a decrease in temperature from 20°C to 3°C was found to increase bubble production in seawater by nearly 50%. These effects appear to be separate from coalescence inhibition, the factor usually cited for differences in bubble populations in fresh water and seawater.

abstract = {As part of an investigation into the detailed characteristics of wave impacts, experimental data are presented for the impact pressures and forces generated by waves up to 1.7 m high breaking onto a vertical wall and a wall inclined at 27° to the vertical. Particular attention is given to the influence of entrained and entrapped air and, by selecting regular wave conditions that produce impacts, trends are identified for highly variable phenomena that could easily be missed when masked by the even greater variability associated with irregular waves. The characteristics of the impacts are found to depend on the breaker conditions and four different types of impact are identified and discussed. The distinctive features of low-aeration and high-aeration impacts are considered in some detail and it is shown that a high level of aeration does not always reduce the peak pressure although it tends to increase both the rise time and duration. Consequently, high levels of aeration can increase both the force and impulse on the structure. Alternate compression and expansion of the air can also generate potentially detrimental sub-atmospheric pressures. The largest impact pressures tend to occur around still water level and distributions in terms of both the incident wave height and the peak pressure are presented in dimensionless terms for each type of impact. Although the highest pressures are associated with low- and high-aeration impacts, the results suggest that slightly-breaking and broken wave impacts should not be neglected and percentage exceedance curves are included to give an indication of the frequency of extreme values. Whilst nominally identical waves often produce very different spatial and temporal pressure distributions, the impulse on the structure during an impact is far less variable and is shown to be broadly proportional to the peak momentum flux of the incident waves. The pressures, forces and impulses associated with an impact on the sloping wall tend to be lower than those on the vertical wall in the same circumstances. However, the total impulse caused by a whole wave event (impact plus quasi-hydrostatic phases) is found to be independent of wall slope in accordance with basic principles. The paper concludes by demonstrating that, for the conditions investigated, the impact can account for up to ∼ 30% of the total impulse. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The result of a linear stability calculation of solitary waves which propagate steadily along the free surface of a liquid layer of constant depth is examined numerically by employing a time-stepping scheme based on a boundary-integral method. The initial growth rate that is found for sufficiently small perturbations agrees well with the growth rate expected from the linear stability calculation. In calculating the later ‘nonlinear' stage of the instability, it is found that two distinct types of long-time evolution are possible. These depend only on the sign of the unstable normal-mode perturbatiori that is superimposed initially on the steady wave. The growth of the perturbation ultimately leads to breaking for one sign. Unexpectedly, for the opposite sign, there is a monotonic decrease in the total height of the wave. In this latter case there is a smooth evolution to a stable solitary wave of lesser amplitude but very nearly the same energy. {\textcopyright} 1987, Cambridge University Press.

The approach is validated using previously published experimental results. The time histories of the evolution of green water pressure on the deck, as well as the peak pressure magnitude, are studied at forward speed conditions. The results indicate that peak pressure due to green water increases significantly with vessel speed for all the wavelengths investigated. Investigations with a range of bow rake angle ($\alpha$) indicate that the impact pressure decreases with the increase of ‘$\alpha$'. For the range of ‘$\alpha$' chosen (0 degrees to 30 degrees), the differences in impact pressure are within 20% of the value for the vertical bow.},

The main theoretical aspects of the new model are discussed. Numerical simulations obtained from the derived third-order non-linear mathematical model are compared to experimental results, corresponding to excessive motions of the model of a transom stern fishing vessel in head seas.

abstract = {Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a ubiquitous component of the open ocean dissolved matter pool, and is important owing to its influence on the optical properties of the water column, its role in photochemistry and photobiology, and its utility as a tracer of deep ocean biogeochemical processes and circulation. In this review, we discuss the global distribution and dynamics of CDOM in the ocean, concentrating on developments in the past 10 years and restricting our discussion to open ocean and deep ocean (below the main thermocline) environments. CDOM has been demonstrated to exert primary control on ocean color by its absorption of light energy, which matches or exceeds that of phytoplankton pigments in most cases. This has important implications for assessing the ocean biosphere via ocean color-based remote sensing and the evaluation of ocean photochemical and photobiological processes. The general distribution of CDOM in the global ocean is controlled by a balance between production (primarily microbial remineralization of organic matter) and photolysis, with vertical ventilation circulation playing an important role in transporting CDOM to and from intermediate water masses. Significant decadal-scale fluctuations in the abundance of global surface ocean CDOM have been observed using remote sensing, indicating a potentially important role for CDOM in ocean-climate connections through its impact on photochemistry and photobiology. {\textcopyright} 2013 by Annual Reviews.

abstract = {A synergic 3-D experimental and numerical investigation is conducted for wave-ship interactions involving the water-on-deck and slamming phenomena. The adopted solver has been developed in Greco and Lugni (in press) and combines (A) a weakly nonlinear external solution for the wave-vessel interactions with (B) a 2-D in-deck shallow-water approximation, which describes water shipping events, and (C) a local analytical analysis of the bottom-slamming phenomenon. This solver can handle regular and irregular sea states and vessels at rest or with limited speed. The experiments examine a patrol ship at rest or with forward speed that is free to oscillate in heave and pitch in regular and irregular waves. In this study, the head-sea regular-wave conditions are examined in terms of (1) response amplitude operators (RAOs) and relative motions, (2) occurrence, features and loads of water-on-deck, bottom-slamming and flare-slamming events and (3) added resistance in waves. A systematic and comprehensive analysis of the phenomena is made available in terms of the Froude number, incoming wavelength-to-ship length ratio and wave steepness for the examined ship geometry. The main parameters that affect the global and local quantities are identified and possible danger in terms of water-on-deck severity and structural consequences are determined. Different slamming behaviors were identified, depending on the spatial location of the impact on the vessel: single-peak, church-roof and double-peak behaviors. A bottom-slamming criterion, using the Ochi's (1964) velocity condition and the Greco and Lugni's (2012) pressure condition, is assessed. A statistical analysis of more than 100 events is needed for the bottom-slamming pressure peaks. The numerical solver is promising. The major discrepancies with the experiments are discussed, and the importance of viscous hull damping and flare impact for the most violent conditions is emphasized. Inclusion of these effects improved the numerical solution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Developing a high-level autonomous collision avoidance system for ships that can operate in an unstructured and unpredictable environment is challenging. Particularly in congested sea areas, each ship should make decisions continuously to avoid collisions with other ships in a busy and complex waterway. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that a large number of marine collision accidents are caused by or are related to human decision failures concerning a lack of situational awareness and failure to comply with the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). In this study, we propose an efficient method to overcome multiship collision avoidance problems based on the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm by expanding our previous study (Zhao et al., 2019). The proposed method directly maps the states of encountered ships to an ownship's steering commands in terms of rudder angle using the Deep Neural Network (DNN). This DNN is trained over multiple ships in rich encountering situations using the policy-gradient based DRL algorithm. To address multiple encountered ships, we classify them into four regions based on COLREGs, and consider only the nearest ship in each region. We validate the proposed collision avoidance method in a variety of simulated scenarios with thorough performance evaluations, and demonstrate that the final DRL controller can obtain time efficient and collision-free paths for multiple ships. Simulation results indicate that multiple ships can avoid collisions with each other while following their own predefined paths simultaneously. In addition, the proposed approach demonstrates its excellent adaptability to unknown complex environments with various encountered ships.},

The first two stages are mainly governed by the air leakage, the last two by the surrounding hydrodynamic flow, which contributes to compressing the bubble horizontally and to convecting it up the wall. Ullage pressure affects the ratio between the minimum and maximum cavity areas. An ullage pressure of 2.5% of the atmospheric pressure leads to an area ratio of about 360% of the equivalent ratio at atmospheric conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {At the turn of 2007 full scale wave impact tests have been carried out by MARIN in the frame of the Sloshel project. Unidirectional breaking waves were generated in a flume in order to impact an instrumented transverse wall with embedded test structures. The main goals of these tests were to study the hydro-elastic effects associated with the NO96 membrane containment system for LNG carriers and to create a sound database for validation of numerical simulations. The preliminary results were overviewed in 2009 by Brosset et al. Since then the full scale tests have been repeated at scale 1 to 6 in order to study the scaling effects. These tests are referred to as the large scale tests. The large scale test set-up mimicked as far as possible the full scale setup. At both scales the instrumentation consisted of multiple pressure sensors, accelerometers and load cells. Special attention was paid to observe the shapes of the breaking waves while impacting. This was obtained by optical sensors at full scale and high speed cameras at large scale, both synchronized with the data acquisition systems. These recordings provided insight in the sloshing physics and enabled to determine characteristic quantities like the amount of entrapped air for air pocket impacts and the corresponding oscillation frequencies. In order to compare deterministically measured impact pressures at both scales a similarity must be ensured on the global flow from the wave paddle to the instant just before the first contact with the wall. Such a similarity has not been achieved. Reasons for that are analysed and recommendations for further tests at full scale are given. Nevertheless a comparison is proposed restrained to global parameters describing gas pocket impacts like pressure within the gas pocket, frequency of the oscillations when compressed and damping coefficient of these oscillations. The similarity at both scales is based on the surface of the gas pocket when closing. So-called compressibility bias demonstrated theoretically and illustrated numerically by Braeunig et al., (2009) is confirmed experimentally. The 1D simplified model of Bagnold (1939) is presented to explain the process. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

abstract = {Rotor/ship aerodynamic interaction is a challenging problem that significantly affects various aspects of shipboard rotorcraft operations, including performance, stability, control, and loads. Therefore it is essential to accurately capture this interaction for application in both engineering analysis and real time fight simulation. The complicated aerodynamic interaction requires a first principle based solution for needed accuracy. However, CFD is computationally expensive and cannot be directly used in fight simulation and therefore, CFD generated ship airwake has traditionally been applied using table lookup methods in rotorcraft analysis and fight simulation. These methods are limited by the capability of computational systems to store large amounts of pre-generated ship airwake interference data. Moreover, when mutual aerodynamic interaction is considered, the airwake table is governed by a large number of rotor and ship parameters which further dramatically increases the table dimension and the storage overhead and restricts the ability to per- form a rigorous rotor/ship interaction study that can capture all the essential aerodynamic phenomena. A POD based Reduced Order Model (ROM) was developed to address the limitations of using a table lookup method. The ROM is an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) approximation of the CFD governing equations that can effectively model the fundamental physical phenomena in a computationally efficient manner. The ROM was calibrated to improve its stability and was validated for a 2-D cylinder case where it showed excellent correlation with CFD results. This ROM was further tested for an isolated ship case and one with a coupled rotor disk and ship model. The model shows reasonable predictions for both the cases, though the rotor/ship case is seen to be more complex to model using ROM due to the strong coupling between rotor and ship airwake that creates a highly unsteady aerodynamic environment.},

abstract = {The characteristics of turbulence created by a plunging breaker on a 1 on 35 plane slope have been studied experimentally in a two-dimensional wave tank. The experiments involved detailed measurements of fluid velocities below trough level and water surface elevations in the surf zone using a fibre-optic laser-Doppler anemometer and a capacitance wave gage. The dynamical role of turbulence is examined making use of the transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy (the k-equation). The results show that turbulence under a plunging breaker is dominated by large-scale motions and has certain unique features that are associated with its wave condition. It was found that the nature of turbulence transport in the inner surf zone depends on a particular wave condition and it is not similar for different types of breakers. Turbulent kinetic energy is transported landward under a plunging breaker and dissipated within one wave cycle. This is different from spilling breakers where turbulent kinetic energy is transported seaward and the dissipation rate is much slower. The analysis of the k-equation shows that advective and diffusive transport of turbulence play a major role in the distribution of turbulence under a plunging breaker, while production and dissipation are not in local equilibrium but are of the same order of magnitude. Based on certain approximate analytical approaches and experimental measurements it is shown that turbulence production and viscous dissipation below trough level amount to only a small portion of the wave energy loss caused by wave breaking. It is suggested that the onshore sediment transport produced by swell waves may be tied in a direct way to the unique characteristics of turbulent flows in these waves.},

Here we show by studying the formation of water drops that the surface tension of a freshly created water surface is even higher (∼90 mN m-1) than under equilibrium conditions (∼72 mN m-1) with a relaxation process occurring on a long time scale (∼1 ms). Dynamic adsorption effects of protons or hydroxides may be at the origin of this dynamic surface tension. However, changing the pH does not significantly change the dynamic surface tension. It also seems unlikely that hydrogen bonding or dipole orientation effects play any role at the relatively long time scale probed in the experiments.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that the integration of the recently developed dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with a multi-resolution analysis allows for a decomposition method capable of robustly separating complex systems into a hierarchy of multi-resolution time-scale components. A one-level separation allows for background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) separation of dynamical data, or robust principal component analysis. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD) method is demonstrated on several examples involving multi-scale dynamical data, showing excellent decomposition results, including sifting the El Ni\$\sim$no mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at different rates against a slowly varying background. These examples show that the decomposition is an effective dynamical systems tool for data-driven discovery.},

The consequences of wave slamming can be mitigated through a combination of enhancing structural design and implementing preventative operation procedures. The design of a FPSO is dependent on the installation site. This requires direct calculation tools, however a complete analysis system does not seem to be available. This paper presents a direct calculation approach, which may be used for designing shell scantlings of a FPSO's bow against wave impact loads. This approach includes determining ship motions relative to waves, calculating wave slamming pressure, analyzing structural responses, and judging acceptance of a design. This approach is based on some engineering programs and analytical formulae; therefore, it is also a practical engineering analysis methodology. Its practicability is demonstrated by applying it to the design of a FPSO's bow for three different installation sites. The approach is applicable to both new constructions and conversions, and can be used for investigating damages due to wave slamming.},

The purpose of the measurement campaign is to determine the evolution of the kinematics of breaking focussed waves. In addition to the PIV measurements in waves, small scale wave-in-deck impact load measurements on a fixed deck box were carried out in the same wave conditions. To investigate the link between wave kinematics and wave-in-deck impact loads, simplified loading models for estimating horizontal deck impact loads were applied and compared to the measured impact loads. In this paper, the comparison of the model test data to estimated loads is presented.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers. In a bold experiment, the Basque Government constructed an innovative oscillating water column (OWC) power station breakwater outside the small fishing port of Mutriku during 2007-2008. While the main structure was a rubble mound, the OWC section of the breakwater consisted of 16 chambered vertical wall units formed by stacked concrete layers. Before the power station could be completed however, storms hit the breakwater in December 2007 and March 2008). A further storm in January 2009 result in severe structural damage to a number of the OWC cells. Previous papers have explained some of the contributions to damage, but have not described detailed flows, loads, and consequent responses. In order to understand the causes of the damage, this paper will describe recent numerical model (CFD) experiments to calculate flows, pressures, and resulting loads at critical positions within the OWC cells, both for the intended operational condition (H s =8m, T P =12.8s), and January 2009 storm wave conditions (H s =13.7m, T P =14.5s). OpenFOAM CFD modelling tools have been used, supported in part by contemporaneous large scale physical model tests in the GWK in Hannover. The CFD modelling has examined key flow processes and dynamic pressures to explore whether these may explain the onset of damage to the OWC cells. Modelling so far suggests that impulsive pressures were developed within OWC chambers where the air turbine or control valves had not been fitted. Around critical corners of the front face and OWC chamber, flows, and pressures following impulsive processes may have seen the onset of cavitation, potentially leading to localised failures, particularly at joints between the stacked cell units.},

abstract = {In many situations across computational science and engineering, multiple computational models are available that describe a system of interest. These different models have varying evaluation costs and varying fidelities. Typically, a computationally expensive high-fidelity model describes the system with the accuracy required by the current application at hand, while lower-fidelity models are less accurate but computationally cheaper than the high-fidelity model. Outer-loop applications, such as optimization, inference, and uncertainty quantification, require multiple model evaluations at many different inputs, which often leads to computational demands that exceed available resources if only the high-fidelity model is used. This work surveys multifidelity methods that accelerate the solution of outer-loop applications by combining high-fidelity and low-fidelity model evaluations , where the low-fidelity evaluations arise from an explicit low-fidelity model (e.g., a simplified physics approximation, a reduced model, a data-fit surrogate) that approximates the same output quantity as the high-fidelity model. The overall premise of these multifidelity methods is that low-fidelity models are leveraged for speedup while the high-fidelity model is kept in the loop to establish accuracy and/or convergence guarantees. We categorize multifidelity methods according to three classes of strategies: adaptation, fusion, and filtering. The paper reviews multifidelity methods in the outer-loop contexts of uncertainty propagation, inference, and optimization.},

We use the next-generation ultra-high-speed video camera, capable of 1 million f.p s (Etoh et al 2002), to study the dynamics of this air sheet as it contracts due to surface tension, to form a bubble or, more frequently, splits into two bubbles. During the contraction of the air disk an azimuthal undulation, resembling a pearl necklace, develops along its edge. The contraction speed of the sheet is accurately described by a balance between inertia and surface tension. The average initial thickness of the air sheet decreases with higher impact Reynolds numbers, becoming less than one micron. The total volume of air entrapped depends strongly on the bottom curvature of the drop at impact. A sheet of micro-bubbles is often observed along the original interface. Oguz-Prosperetti bubble rings are also observed. For low Weber numbers (We < 20) a variety of other entrapment phenomena appear.},
